Five days ago, war broke out between Iran and Israel.

I realized something terrible had happened when our house suddenly shook, and the windows made a terrifying noise.
My wife — the person I love most in this world, whose pain is unbearable for me — jumped up and asked, “What happened?”
I told her it was thunder, but deep down, I knew it wasn’t. Moments later, the air raid sirens started.

I looked at her and said, “Israel is attacking.”

She panicked, got dressed quickly, and sat down on the floor, completely shocked. I ran outside and could see smoke and flames in the distance. A house not far from ours had been destroyed.
People were coming out of their homes. My father, who lives in the apartment above us, rushed outside in fear.

That moment was one of the hardest of my life. I know it might sound silly, but I was deeply afraid.
At the same time, I had to stay calm and try to comfort my wife — distract her, protect her.

Two days later, we left Tehran and moved to a quieter place in nature. Here, there are no explosions or sirens. But my wife is still anxious. Every day brings more bad news. She keeps asking me, “What’s going to happen?”

I’m heartbroken — not only because of the war, but because of her pain. I can’t bear to see her suffer.

I’m doing my best to keep us distracted, to keep her smiling, even just a little.
Sorry for the long message. I just needed to share this with someone.
If you have any advice or thoughts, I would really appreciate it.
Thank you."
2,2,"I want to know out interest...and to also feel not so alone. 

My event happened in Kenya 2023, I'm married to a kenyan man and his family are constantly asking us to travel with them....I've flaked on the last 2 occasions because I just dont feel ready even 2 years later....

Has anyone managed to visit *that * particular location? If so how long did it take you to even get to a healthy emotional place?? "
3,3,"I need advice. 

How do go about answering casual questions like ‘how was your day’ or ‘what’s going on?’ when it all feels awful. 

I feel like I keep accidentally pushing away possible connections and friends by spilling too much info. I can’t stop trauma dumping and I’ve become super reclusive as a result. 

It’s all I can think about, when someone asks ‘what’s wrong?’ It’s game over, I’m spilling everything and nobody is ever prepared to hear that type of information. "
4,1,"My mind is constantly telling me that everyone hates me, looks down on me, finds me annoying and wants to bully, abuse and isolate me just like when I was at school. There isn't a single day I don't spend time thinking about all sorts of scenarios that end up with me killing those bullying me and those standing aside, as well as anyone coming to their defense.

And I feel like it's coming to a breaking point, and I'm genuinely afraid I might act on these thoughts one day.

In a way, I find peace in the thought that rather than just killing myself, I'll also take down my bullies and abusers with me.

I also always feel like I need to be in full control over the situation and over other people's thoughts and feelings."
5,1,This time of year is tough for trauma anniversaries galore. I have the first anniversary of something I’m really not quite over coming up and I can feel my body just struggling with it. I want to put together a little self care box. I wondered if anybody had anything similar and what you include in them? Thank you 
6,1,I’m not ‘here’ sometimes but then I’m ‘here’ sometimes. I don’t know when I’m ‘here’ or not. When I exist or not exist. It’s confusing. I have no identity nothing. This constant identity problem. It’s a feeling I’m not always ‘there’. I sound insane. It makes no sense. I have to be here I can’t suddenly not be ‘there.’ It feels isolating and lonely.
7,2,"My current partner is the first one to ever ask for sexual favors. It's literally just him asking for a BJ maybe once or twice a month. He does not force me or pressure me. If I say no, he will leave it alone and not try to guilt me. Logically in my mind I know that it's not a big deal whatsoever, he's not asking for a lot, but for some reason when he asks for it from me my brain just digs its heels in and I don't want to do it. I'll be in a great mood, but when he asks for it it's like this wave of tension, despair, and irritation falls over me. I have no problem initiating favors and acts without them being requested though. I think it maybe has to do with my brain not feeling in control again somehow?"

Okay, so, I’m an autistic woman, btw, with an anxiety disorder. I stay inside a lot. I’ve no friends in real life. Only on the internet.

I had a friend on an app for almost three years. He missed me when I was gone for a while. He told me I was his favourite person on there & he was mine. He was actually (& still is) one of me favourite people in the world.

His account got suspended & I’d make loads of posts asking people if they knew what happened before I learnt it was suspended. I hated the fact he was gone & was waiting ages for him to come back. & just felt like yk he wouldn’t like abandon me.

& he did come back & told me he was looking for me for ages & was so happy when he found one of me posts. Told me he missed seeing me rants & I was delighted bcz I missed him too. & only really enjoyed the app bcz of him. I wanted to leave it loads but didn’t want to abandon him especially seeing how he didn’t like when I wasn’t around.

Ehh so recently he told me he was okay & that life was good like when texting me. Then a day or two later he made a post saying he’s not slept for three days bcz he’s monitoring the situation & that he just needs a hug & several years of warmth & darkness. So I texted him apologising for me recent text saying “hope you’ve a lovely, lovely day” & said that seems insensitive of me to say & asked if there’s anything I could do & how I’d fight the people bothering him for him. He told me it’s grand & that I couldnt have known.

He explains some man tried to intimidate him & he got him to go away & threatened him. Kept telling me he was grand. & I told him I’m glad he did that & how I felt useless (we live in different countries) being all the way where I am unable to help & referenced his post, the one where he said he needs a hug & several years of warmth & darkness. He just kept saying not to worry about him & that he’s a strong soldier n all.

He told me he’s always in survival mode & has been since his friend died in his arms when he was teen. I told him I was really sorry to hear that & that he’s been through so much & that it’s completely understandable.

I asked if he’ll be getting any rest tonight & what he’ll be up to. He said he’s going for drinks with his friends. I said i hope his friends take good care of him & that I was gunna go to sleep. He told me he’s thankful for all me kind messages & that he really appreciates me & that I’m a good friend. He said he hopes I’ve a good sleep & said you too. & that was that

Then I wake up the next morning & I’m blocked. & initially I tell meself it’s okay. He was probably embarrassed? About what he told me? Or regrets it? Like I would deactivate me account loads when I made vulnerable posts on there, so I thought it could be that. & for some reason, I just assumed the block would be temporary. I also wondered well he said he was going out for some for drinks. So he might’ve blocked me accidentally? & meant to block someone else?

It was literally a nightmare come true & an unimaginable thing for me, something I never thought would ever happen never in a million years. & I don understand it.

& of course I’m hurt bcz the friends I had in school bullied me, then the other ones also bullied me but then stopped for a bit & now don’t want anything to do with me.

Friendships for me don’t usually last. & I do feel like people don’t like me which I hear is common for autistics to feel. Like I don’t have this strong desire for friends. I feel like I’d live longer without them bcz then I’d be hurt less. Just I would prefer not to lose amazing people like that. I really really really really really liked him a lot! I also told him this in our last convo when explaining why I felt awful not being able to help. I’m aromantic btw so no it’s not romantic.

Have been in tears for three days & literally going to sleep in tears waking up & remembering & ij tears. & I’m just confused like I don’t think he lied about appreciating me. I just don’t see why he wouldn’t like at least let me know he doesn’t want anything to do with me anymore. I wouldn’t have argued. I mean I understand I’m not entitled to that. & he doesn’t have to explain anything to me. I just would like to know what I did wrong? I spoke to someone about this & they said it mightn’t have ahyhinf to do with me at all.

It’s really shite lol his bio says he’s looking for his old friends. & I was one & he found me & now I’m blocked & I’m just so upset like. Just never feel good enough to be anyone’s friend & I do feel disposable. Like I’m the friend everyone blocks & nobody wants. Did I make him uncomfortable? Probably suffocated him? If he told me to feck off I would have understood. The way he kept telling me not to worry was probably a kinder way of telling me to feck off, I think.

9,2,"This is my story of the time I ate 5 dried grams of magic mushrooms when I was 18 and left me with diagnosed Panic disorder and PTSD. 

I was 18, fresh out of college and not knowing where to go in life. I was smoking weed everyday, using other drugs and kind of lost in life. After watching thousands of videos about the positive benefits of shrooms and how it saved so many peoples lives, I decided to ""save my life"" and do a heroic dose of mushrooms, by myself in silent darkness. 

I waited till almost midnight and ate the 5Gs, I also smoked a lot of weed right after I ate them to get the maximum trip I could get. I turned the lights off and laid in bed and was coming up, I remember feeling really irritable, nervous, agitated, I couldn't stop moving and squirming, I saw thousands of demons faces telling me I can't come in, your not welcome, kind of mocking me. All of a sudden it was like the plug was pulled, my soul my everything, launched into the infinity of space, I felt weightless, I felt like nothing but everything at the same time but to me It felt exactly like I just died. EGO DEATH. I touched my face and my hands went through my face, it was then when it happened. FULL BLOWN PANIC ATTACK.

I jumped out of bed and ran to my door, I could see light in the door hinges getting further away, as I was getting smaller and slower, to me It felt like if I didn't reach that door, I was dead. I got to the door swang it open ran to the mirror, saw a reptillian creature but it was me. I expected to see my face all gored up or something, I remember hearing the world ending, I ran back in my room in full blown panic heart rate 200+bpm and I couldn't think. It was too intense, I couldn't believe what had just happened to me I was in shock, I just kept repeating, I'm dying, I'm dying. I had forgotten I had even taken the shrooms at this point all I knew is that I was dying. I felt my heart being stabbed, grabbed, pulled, flutttering. I grabbed my phone to call 911 and my arms turned into old peoples arms then turned burnt and scolded and I threw the phone in panic. I had accepted my death, my eyes had the 1000 yard stare, I imagined my family coming to see me dead with foam coming out of my mouth. This lasted hours, no words can describe the terror, the horror, something so fucking horrific the human being isnt designed to experience such terror.

After the trip finally started to come down, I couldn't think straight, severe brain fog, I couldn't see straight, I was literally cross eyed after it happened, my eyes couldn't focus properly, I've never heard of this happenening to other people but my eyes stopped working properly for a few hours after it happened. Caused so much fucking trauma/shock my eyes couldn't even work. After it happened I felt really really differen't, I wasn't the same person anymore, even talking to my family felt weird, talking to friends felt weird, I felt like an alien. I was in a chronic anxiety attack with depersonalization/derealization/dissociation and I had no idea what was wrong with me, I thought I had developed schizophrenia. 

After a month thinking I was schizophrenic or in a psychosis, I had 1 beer, and EVERYTHING washed away. All the anxiety, all the tension, everything washed away and I felt great. I became an alcoholic instantly, it was the only thing in the world they gave me relief from what I was feeling. I was an alcoholic for 5 years, until it almost left me dead and in the hospital for 2 weeks for severe alcohol withdrawal. 

Now I'm picking up the pieces, I have stopped drinking, I'm seeing a gp every week, Psycholigist, Therapy, Psychiatrist. I am diagnosed with Generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, Panic disorder and PTSD. I've tried several medications and they all don't work for my type of anxiety. Even the doctors and psychatrists look at me and just have no fucking idea what to do with me.

Well thats my story, 100% real and 100% what happened to me, not talking shit about shrooms because even after this experience I've done small doses of shrooms and had lots of fun, though I was drunk. But beware, Psychedelics fucked me up more than any drug I've ever done and I will be carrying this PTSD and panic disorder for the rest of my life, and struggle with benzos and alcohol for the rest of my life. "
10,0,"I never imagined I’d reach a place where I could say this, but I’m finally starting to feel safe again, not just physically, but emotionally, mentally, in my own body.

I’m someone who has lived in survival mode for most of my life. The trauma I experienced wasn't just ""in the past""; it stayed with me in how I flinched when people raised their voice, how I apologized for things that weren’t my fault, how I couldn’t sleep without hours of spiraling first. I spent years walking on emotional eggshells, stuck in a cycle of self-blame and dissociation.

Eventually, I sought help. It took everything in me to reach out to a therapist. I still remember how nervous I was before the first session. I didn’t even know what I wanted to say. But I’m so grateful I pushed through the fear. My therapist never rushed me. They gave me space to tell my story in my own time. And for the first time, I was met with compassion instead of judgment.

I also started exploring movement again. At first, it was just stretching, then slow yoga, short walks, and breathing exercises. I was surprised by how emotional it felt just to be present in my own body. But over time, that presence became grounding instead of overwhelming.

Alongside therapy and movement, I paid more attention to how my body was functioning. I struggled with fatigue and poor sleep, and after talking it through with my doctor, I started a basic wellness routine, hydration, better nutrition, and a few supplements, like Nova Health. I want to be clear: I’m not saying it “fixed” anything, there’s no magic pill. But I noticed that with consistent care, including Nova, my energy improved slightly, my sleep got more regular, and I felt a bit more balanced. For me, it was one piece of a much bigger healing puzzle.

There were days I wanted to quit. Days when the past felt heavier than my progress. But something I’ve learned through therapy is that progress doesn’t always look like forward motion; sometimes it’s just staying still, not running, not avoiding. That’s healing, too.

I still live with PTSD. There are triggers I manage every day. But I now have tools I never had before: language, self-awareness, and support. I’ve built a life where I’m allowed to say no, to rest, to have boundaries.

If you’re reading this and feel like you’re drowning in it, please know that you are not alone. Healing isn’t linear, and it isn’t fast. But it is possible. Not perfect, not pain free, but more peaceful.

Wishing peace to anyone out there who needs it today. You deserve it."
11,2,"I grew up with a YouTuber named DanTDM, and I watched his videos roughly between the ages of 9 and 12, maybe 13. He's been around for over a decade, and he's still making videos to this day. Despite not watching him all that often anymore, he's someone I hold near and dear to my heart.

Well today I found a video he put out recently where he shaves his head due to his hair thinning. The result was him looking somewhat bald, with a thin beard. And it reminded me of my emotionally abusive father.

My father is also bald with a beard, but his beard is thicker than Dan's, he has a different hair color, his glasses look way different, and he doesn't have ear piercings. And yet, I was still reminded of him when I watched the video, and felt rather uncomfortable and distressed.

Now I've only been out of his household for less than a month at this point, and only learned of my PTSD not too long ago, so this is all kind of new to me. I don't even know if I have PTSD or C-PTSD.

So I'm really worried about the possibility of being reminded of my father whenever I see anyone who looks even remotely similar to him. Even with so many major differences, and my emotional connection to him, just the fact that I saw Dan as bald with a slight beard was enough for me to feel discomfort by looking at him.

Will this issue ever get any better? How can I deal with it? Any advice is really appreciated. Thank you."
12,2,"My past two relationships have been really bad when it comes to me bringing up an issue and being completely stonewalled and made to feel crazy/the bad and just outright abandoned after I have an issue. 

I’m in a new relationship and he is amazing but I feel panic even now. I brought up and issue and after I feel like something bad is going to happen. I’m freaking out and i feel like everything is going to fall apart. He responded well and felt bad but I just feel like my body is having a physical reaction to an impending doom that’s not even there. I also feel a strong sense of regret and guilt even though it was perfectly reasonable. 

I assume it’s probably some really mild form of PTSD/trauma. Anyone have any advice please so I can get past this because I don’t want this to be destructive to new relationship. 

Please any help is appreciated "
13,2,I feel like since I got diagnosed with PTSD my brain has gone into a full blown panic. I knew I was depressed and had anxiety and possibly even BPD but PTSD was not even on my radar and idk why it’s got me so mentally fucked up. Im getting further diagnosed and evaluated in a couple weeks. I’m not even sure what I’m asking advice on to be honest.  I feel like it’s a ramble but if you have any advice on well… anything to help me relax my mind for even a minute. 
14,3,"I used to love storms. I always found them so pretty and I would always sit on the porch to watch them come in. I had a couple close calls in storms years ago that I think back on fondly as funny memories because being in a storm made me feel so happy and alive. Rain, thunder, tornadoes, hail, snow, anything. I loved it. They used to bring me so much peace when dealing with the actual events that led to my ptsd. 

Last year I had to evacuate due to a natural disaster and almost lost a friend to it, and now any natural phenomenon stresses me out. I get so upset when I start to panic at hearing thunder now, or how I rush to get inside instead of enjoying the rain. 

It really and truly was such a joy in my life that I've suddenly lost to a situation that was only minorly traumatic at worst. I've just gotten a taste of worst case scenario and I can't seem to let it go. It really is killing me to no longer find the beauty and joy in a storm and only being able to focus on the horrible things they can do. "
15,2,"i had to live with my drug addict older brother for years as his addiction progressively got worse and he had drug psychosis for a lot of it and it was a nightmare. i would come home from work and every day it was something different, screaming,shouting, attacking us, fighting people that didn’t exist ending up in broken bones, throwing up, screaming fits, been woken up every night to him screaming and shouting or running around the house being terrifying, or him passed out almost dead in his room, opening/closing doors all the time etc. it’s been a year since he was kicked out but ever since i have been so sensitive to any noise. i can convince myself that any noise is somebody in danger, i hear water running outside and i convince myself someone is drowning, somebody makes a weird noise at work in another room and i convince myself they are dying, somebody coughs then is quiet for a long period of time and i convince myself they are dead so i have to go check?!?! has anyone else experienced this and if so do you have any tips on how to deal with it, i feel like it is affecting my life a lot recently, i am constantly having to check on people as my brain convinces me they are in danger.
thanks x"
16,2,"Hey, i’m not really sure on where to ask this question or wether it’s appropriate but recently i’ve been reflecting on myself, my past and my sexual fantasies and i noticed that i’ve always had sexual fantasies like since i was 7 or even younger id think about bdsm like scenarios before i’d sleep because i liked it for some reason. i don’t recall any traumatic event in my life but i do remeber 2 situations. one situation was at my dads place, i was around 5-6 years old i belive and there was porn playing on the tv, i still remeber what happaned and i remeber being confused by it, to this day this is a vivid picture i have in my head. later i started struggling with bad anxiety and derealisation (idk if it’s connected to trauma) and ive been having these fantasies that where misogynistic, weird not- consensual etc and i also started playing some porn games wich where kind of connected to rape most of the time, my dad saw those on my computer and then told me he’s fine with me doing that. Later then when i was 11 or 12 i went on a vacation with my dad and i only remeber feeling super uncomfortable and sexualized by him i dont remeber if something had happaned i think it was just the way he looked at me and something he said about my body but after that i cut him off because i felt so uncomfortable. i dont know if it was just me and i felt uncomfortable with myself because i started developing and stuff and i imagined him to sexualize me or if he actually did. But what i wanted to ask is if watching porn at a young age can cause trauma because i haven’t really thought about if it was a traumatic event or if that could be the reason to all my problems, it feels like it’s not a good reason for my mind to be that messed up but at the same time i don’t think or remeber anything else happening.

thank you for reading and sorry for my english, it’s not my first language !"

***apologies for long post, have lots of thoughts that cannot be summed up shortly lol***

my parents were, well some still are, neglectful. one emotionally and physically distant, the other overbearingly enabling of my undiagnosed mental issues. the types where you let your undiagnosed, obviously adhd children adopt 3 animals and expect them to be the “primary” care givers of these animals. being the only one who was supposed to look after them when i had no idea what to look for. i was a minor going to take my pets to the vet because my father didn’t have the energy type care. with no genuine help at all btw with managing my symptoms as a child performing these hard tasks. and when we did need help, they would make it feel like it was my fault for “not caring enough”, as well as other serious emotional neglect/ mental abuse.  just serious guilt ridden feelings when i feel like im taking on my parents burden. 

im newly 20f and freshly coming out of the neglect/ taking the steps to properly take care of the family animals (which immensely improved with the help of my adhd care/ trauma therapy) i was faced with as a child/teen, primarily by my father, along with the neglect type behaviors my parents instilled upon me. 

my father is a first gen mexican immigrant, he is hardworking and cares for our family, but he also has chronic depression, and chronic illness he doesn’t take care of really, so i have to bear the burden of taking care of him and his emotions as well, since i rely on him for shelter in this economy. this has been going on since i was 12. my mother and sister, whom i relied on the most in my formative years spoiled my sisters dog, and ofc little baby adhd me with my cats. made sure he got a bath, was socially stimulated, “helped”us feed the animals when we were too busy being literal children with homework (we would get scolded for this though and they would threaten to take away the animals, which would make sense if we were actually properly cared for by our parents ourselves) , etc. my mother also, in that same, confusing, most painful breath, got my cats declawed when i was 8- 9 years old. this was the first one of my trauma blanks. 

she ended up passing away when i was 12, but i hadn’t really fully healed the guilt i would feel in her place. it eats me up that she passed before i could talk to her about this and get closure, but that won’t happen. this lead to me getting diagnosed with depression,ptsd and ocd, as well as general grief from losing my mom, this seemingly confusing figure of a woman, all at 13-17 years old, all while doing my absolute best to make these pets feel deserved, with the little knowledge i had on what that actually meant. i moved out at 18 for trade school, but eventually had to move back home due to mental illness. this is where it all hit me. the realization from what was normal vs what was not normal is heartbreaking and embarrassing, especially if you were a child absorbing these behaviors. 

my father does not provide adequate care, or at least from my pov post brainwash, he instilled the mentality of “he’s just a dog”, which is sadly common in some latin american homes, “that dogs belong outside, they’re always gonna be dirty so there’s no point in giving them a bath all the time”, etc. all this was instilled in my brain since 12, when my mom passed. he hasn’t even taken him to get his check up while i was living away for school for a year which i found out a couple of days ago. 

we have a huge yard so at least he is recieving exercise, but he just does not get enough mental stimulation anymore, advice on how to stimulate senior dogs would be immensely helpful. advice on taking care of declawed pets in the long run would also be greatly appreciated. i’ve decided on switching their litter routine to see if soft, paw sensitive litter might be the route, or towels of some sort since they used to love peeing on my clothes (which i now know is a sign of litter box pain :/ ). 

doggo is fed every morning and evening without fail, so are the cats, so he’s not neglectful on that end while i was gone at school. he helps me feed the cats now if im somewhere and i cannot be there without fail, as well as when he wakes up in the mornings since they love to yell at him (justified) for their breakfast at 8 am (before i wake up), and he just caved and took the responsibility (like he should’ve in the first place when he realized his daughter had untreated mental illness as an 8 year old ??) idk. just no walks, no bath, and no check ups on his end really scared me and made me sick. 

i made them all appointments this week with the veterinarian i take my own cat i got in 2022 after my attempt, whom has been my kickstart to breaking the patterns my parents had instilled in me for so long, which i can say im proud of myself for i guess. doggo is on a sick exam since he has a cough that has grown to sound more intense with his age, and my two fur babies on another sick exam to check for heartworms/ regular routine check up since they’ve been developing little scabs on their heads? ( i assumed since they play fight so much it would make sense, but they’ve grown and gone away and come back more and it worried me it might be something like flea/ dermal problems). 

i still carry the immense amount of guilt the pressure of taking care of life as a child when your family cannot even take care of you. i raised myself, and while i am far from perfect, was handed lack luster animal care not beyond just cuddles and occasional walks, i know i will be the best pet mom ever with the education and health i have now as a new found adult, i just feel like they do not deserve me and i dont know where to hold that. i feel like i should be doing more. im new on this journey. a couple months new, overwhelmed of course, but hopeful, with support from fellow pet owning friends/ partner. i still feel like im not doing enough though and its eating me up. how do i feel like i deserve these animals as a healing adult now, and not like a monster like my parents? thanks for making it this far.

18,2,"So for a short backstory my significant other had a rough childhood along with abusing alcohol for five years. Recently she has started going to therapy and psychiatry and taking it seriously. But she's been having intense flashbacks to which she describes to me as feeling as though nothing is real and she feels stuck in a box watching her former self go through all these bad moments. And I was just wondering if there is any advice out there for me to help or for her to help herself. 

As a side note her therapist just keeps telling her to let go of the past but she isn't sure how to do that and I kinda tried telling her in a nice way that I don't think you can necessarily let it go but you can more accept these thoughts and stuff and try to work with and live with them but I'm so worried that was awful advice. Please don't come for me everyone makes mistakes and I'm posting this to hopefully avoid mistakes. I want to do everything I can to make sure that she will be okay. Thank you so much for reading."
19,1,"I don't really know what to say here. I got diagnosed with ptsd almost a year ago now and im struggling to understand it. All my life people have called my crasy, I never thought that of myself untill a few months ago. Over the last 6 months I've noticed myself feeling so out of it and all over the place. I feel like im losing my mind yk? I've tried meds and therapy but nothing has helped. I've come here to ask real people on how they navigate life? I've never met someone else who's been diagnosed because I can't talk to people. I don't even know if all of this is because of ptsd or if its something else but point blank is i have no support system or resources to help me im completely on my own. Im only 19 I have so much of a life to live and I just don't know how to navigate this."
20,3,"So about a year ago I got diagnosed with PTSD. I wasn’t surprised, actually pretty excited. I made the mistake of telling my mom because now she thinks it’s from her. Was she the greatest? No. Did it all come from her? Also no. I keep trying to reassure her but she’s making it all about herself when really what I was looking for was like.. SUPPORT. It especially stings because she wants to be a therapist but she’s god awful at listening/supporting me.. Anyways. 

This whole PTSD thing while it’s been there forever, it’s seriously like… I can’t sleep. I am constantly forgetting stuff. I feel useless at work especially because I keep dozing off at work. I’m falling behind in school. Obviously I need to get off my ass and try to come up with a routine but it just feels like really awful, especially because it feels like I need to get all this school stuff out of the way now. So I’m fumbling my grades but HAVE to do better. My parents want me to drive but I’m actually terrified to learn. SCHOOL WORK DRIVING AND PTSD WHY GOD!!!! WHY!2!2!2!!2!2!

21,2,"How to set boundaries with partners alter?



Hey friends, thanks for all you do and for taking the time to read this post. 

I'm on the struggle bus today because of an ongoing issue and I could really use your help in navigating this. My partner had BPD and DID that her psych believes may be PTSD triggered (lots of childhood trauma), I'm very familiar with BPD due to a previous long term partner but I have less experience with DID and PTSD


Anyway, about once a week (or every other week sometimes) there is a particulary aggressive alter that my gf expresses. One of the first signs that it is present is that it goes in the basement and throws this squishy stress ball against the wall that creates a boom like sound through the main floor as it hits the dry wall and frankly if that was all they did there wouldn't be an issue. But that isn't all they do and because of their history with me it generally strikes fear in me when I hear it,it leaves that unsettled stomach feeling. It really is more of a warning of what's coming because often after the ball throwing they come  upstairs, slamming almost every door in their path. They stomp around the house. They yell intermittently, sometimes into the abyss but also often at me saying things like nobody wants them, I never cared about them, I never do anything for them. This is often followed by them going into the kids rooms, packing stuff and saying she is leaving and telling them they are going too, she is wild and manic when she does this and they are visibly afraid., she almost never knows where they would go or even why she is going other than sometimes saying it's not safe here. She switches between alters forgets what has been happening, when I try to catch her up she calls me a liar, she forgets where she puts things through all this too and insists that I took those things. Because of the erratic behavior is scaring the kids and because she has no plan and seems detached from reality I used to try very hard to prevent her from taking them. This almost always leads to even more erratic behavior and threats to call the police. Im just the bf (not my biological kids), I have no legal right so I've limited my intervention to attempting to negotiate but sometimes it's just too much and I have to distance myself, I get symptoms that feel like I'm having a panic attack. So I isolate, box breath and try to give myself space. This more often than not infuriates her,  as a result she rummages from the kitchen drawers like she is going to self harm, she grabs pills as if to threaten over dose, she insists we talk but that generally is mostly her yelling at me and if I apologize about whatever slight caused this she will find something else about me to focus anger on and for hours it doesn't stop. Its important here to mention that I am not violent I don't hit her or degrade her or anything like that. The kids are not biologically mine but treat me like a father figure and I love and care for them very much. Even in these very scary and tense moments I breath deep and do my best to stay calm.  Often these events are triggered with something most would consider minor. It's part of what's scary because it can happen anytime. For example yesterday it seemed to start after I suggested  a time to go to the store that she didn't like, she didn't tell me that at the time, she just went downstairs, later just saying she would just go to the store alone... And from there it built. She has a lot of childhood trauma, I feel awful that she went through all that, I feel even worse that after these episodes when she learns what happened that she is heartbroken. Often I need alone time to heal after these things (which she hates). Things like this have been going on for a while, this year I have really been focusing on trying to create boundaries, when things like this show up I make myself present but let her know that it's not okay for her yell and berate me but that doesn't stop it and it pains me that the kids are involved. This isn't her 95% of the time but I'm at a loss on how to protect myself and the kids from this. how do you make an alter accountable...."
22,2,"Hey everyone, I am looking for advice on a non destructive way to react to anger or criticism of another person. In my younger age my parents used to shout at me a lot and blame me for stuff. So nowadays when my wife becomes angry and starts to raise her voice a bit, I raise mentally a wall up and stop being carrying and understanding. I also might drift away at some point. Anyway, how would you usually deal with situations where you realize that you messed something up (that you can't change very fast) and a person is angry or frustrated with your behavior? (I guess that one of my problems is that I connect the criticism not only to my behavior, but to myself as a person)."
23,1,"I am surrounded by people who love me but they cannot see what I see. But I can see what they see. I feel alone and trapped. 

The people closest to me only see the negative effects of my actions and unfortunately do not see the root cause of these actions. 

When I explain there is deep pain and sorrow inside of me driving my actions, I receive a dismissive ""I'm sorry you feel that way"" or ""it does not excuse your behavior""

There is no empathy. However, I am expected to understand their feelings and acknowledge their pain caused by my actions. 

They will not entertain the idea that maybe their actions or lack thereof may have caused my behavior.

24,3,"In feb of this year, my daughter told me she had been SA by one of her dads friends while with her dad . I flipped out , went over to the guys house and screamed , cussed , threatened and called police to report it in front of him. He set my house on fire with both my children and I in it, sleeping that same night. My front & back doors were on fire I had to throw my children out a window and climb out myself. Dad and I were not together but he did come stay at a hotel with me the first night for moral support. The next day at the hotel the police came to search it due to that friend reporting that we were both on drugs during his interview. Dad was. AND he had it on him at the hotel. He went to jail. I was alone ( which I now realize is better than him being around ) but at the time I didn't . I didn't wanna be alone I was traumatized. Cps got involved and drug screened me , I was living in hotels with 2 young children one of which is autistic for 2 months. Cps came back a month later and said I failed drug screen for meth that I've never done in my life. My level was 10ng. Please pause reading this & already not believing me and google what a users level would be. 500 or more. They told me they are substantiating on me and opening a case for not keeping my daughter safe from that friend, dad having substances around my kid and me failing a drug screen. I was shocked, devastated and refused the informal case they offered told them to take me in front of a judge because all I've bren doing was trying to keep my children safe while also trying to keep my head above water . I've been doing weekly drug screens that have obviously been negative for all substances because I don't use drugs!! My kids were never removed. I got in touch with my local housing agency and they were able to quickly place me in a home , turned out that house had bed bugs . I had to throw all of my stuff away. TVs beds toys clothes everything . Back in hotels . I finally found another home in April . I started from scratch with only an air mattress we all shared for a month. My car broke down and was quoted 3k to fix it at the cheapest. I got a new car , bought us all beds got some tvs food and clothes with my tax return . I'm trying my absolute best to remain sane while still fighting cps's claims working and being a mom . But I don't even feel like myself anymore. I'm just a shell. Like I'm just trying to take care of my kids until they're grown then die at this point. The house I'm in while very grateful to have a roof over my kids heads, just reminds me of everything I went thru to get here and I can't stand to be in it. Will I ever heal & be happy again?? I'm trying to be positive but it seems impossible...."
25,2,"Pisses me off so much. I saw a video of this woman saying she was very afraid of green olives (context said she saw a dead family member w rotting eyes that resembled olives when she was a child), and the host brought a jar of olives. They all laughed and forced her to see the jar while she cried and tried to get away. Makes me so sick that people can be so insensitive.

This made me think about the times I've been told that what triggers me is ridiculous, etc. Or I've heard of others with ptsd that get triggered with unusual stuff get made fun of. I hate that there's so little awareness of something so important that some of us have to live with everyday."
26,2,"Hi everyone I’m new here but I need to vent. I want to give a quick CW for mentions of SA but I won’t go into details. I’m also abbreviating SA for my own sanity so I’m sorry about that if it offends anyone.

I recently started seeing someone new and it’s been going really good. I mentioned to him I have PTSD as a result of childhood trauma and a few things in adulthood but I never specified because I wasn’t ready to talk to him about what happened yet. This morning he texted me and said he had a sex dream about me so me being flirty asked him to tell me about it. The beginning of his dream very much reminded me of when I was SA’d about two years ago. I told him to “please please please never do that to me” and he immediately apologized so I told him we can talk in person about it. 

He’s been apologizing all day and admitted he wants to be more trauma informed because he doesn’t always understand what can be a trigger. Which is understandable because everyone’s triggers are different.

I do really like him but idk if that dream is a dealbreaker for me. It really freaked me out. 

Part of me feels bad because I’m worried I scared him by being upset and I also feel like I should have brought this up before because I’ve been meaning too.

We also had a little run in with the cops a couple weeks ago that was also a trigger for me but not as bad as this.

I’ve come a looooong way in my healing journey over the past like 8/9 months and I’m really proud of myself but I’m also scared this might send me a step back.

Thank you for reading my rant and advice is always appreciated:)
"
27,1,"I had a failed suicide attempt last Tuesday. At least so far failed. I’m still waiting to see if I end up with liver or kidney failure or other organ damage. 

Since my harassment last year which caused me to go into psychosis, I’ve been left terrified to both live and die. 

Terrified to live in case the harassment starts again, and because I’m in mega debt due to job loss in September and living on £877 a month disability which is less than half my monthly bills which I honestly can’t see myself ever getting out of. I already struggled to hold down a job due to autism and anxiety, it feels impossible I’ll ever meaningfully work again. I may be able to, after a long time healing, handle a few part time hours but not enough to survive. 

And terrified to die because my psychosis gave me an out of body experience where I saw myself in hell being beaten by my harasser and although the psychosis has gone, I’m still getting delusions of reference with certain things related to him or the hallucinations I had and I’ve become absolutely CONVINCED when I die - especially if by suicide - I’m going to be eternally punished or fall into this loveless void for all eternity. Doesn’t help that I’ve since read NDEs which eerily correspond with my experience which were from suiciders. 

It’s also brought up a lot of repressed childhood traumas from my infancy/toddlerhood and I’m now looking at the the only person I have for support, my abusive mother, in an even more distant light than I already did. I knew she was abusive but my psychosis brought up memories of being left to cry night after night in a dark room when I was under 2 which she’s confirmed. That’s where that loveless void comes from. 

I’m terrified I’ll experience that same eternal loveless void when I die, or I’ll go to naraka/hell and be punished eternally. My delusions also made me think I would reincarnate perpetually into samsara if I suicide in increasingly impossible situations until my actual -soul- is driven crazy and I can never escape, destined to spend eternity tortured by my harasser in never ending rebirth cycles from which there is no escape possible. 

My whole life has felt like a cruel joke. Everything works against me and I’ve never known love. Now I don’t even have the comfort of suicide without fearing eternal damnation. Meanwhile I’m now coping with an existential crisis waiting to see if I have a delayed reaction to my suicide attempt. This isn’t how I wanted to go, slowly and in agony as my organs fail. I just wanted to go to sleep. It feels like yet another cruel twist - I can’t even kill my self properly. 

I’m trying so hard to write it all off as psychosis but I had things even before my harassment started that I can’t explain that led directly to it in a way that seemed far too organised to be chance. In legit terrified the universe is conspiring against me for some reason and that I was created purely and only to suffer for others enjoyment for eternity. "
28,1,"I'm 43. I feel so lost. 18 months ago I had a severe nervous breakdown & I haven't recovered. I have BPD & was diagnosed with CPTSD. 

I live in continual fear & depression. I think about suicide all the time & I honestly feel like I'll end myself one day. 

I used to have a a great life. I had a beautiful partner, a daughter, 2 homes & a business. I lost everything in January 2024. It broke me. I fell straight into a severe nervous breakdown. 

I literally have been living in misery for 18 months. I'm so scared & live in pure fear. I thought I would have got better by now but the patterning runs so deep. I feel so alone & in despair. 

I have sought out multiple therapists & I have a DBT coach. My last therapist told me to find someone else because I wasn't getting better. So my therapist threw me away exactly like my partner & daughter did. I thought I was getting better a few weeks ago but I relapsed so hard & fast. 

I live in Australia & I've sought out all methods of assistance. There's not much available in the area I live in. I'm literally scared to get out of bed everyday & I just want to cry. I can't even cry. I've tried multiple medications & they all had really negative side affects. I'm addicted to an antipsychotic they prescribed me to stop my body from shaking. If I try to taper off it it sends my suicidal thoughts into overdrive. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I don't have any family & all my friends have faded away. I'm so lost & scared. "
29,2,"Long story short - I started experiencing this intense anxiety 5 years ago, please check my profile for context, you can even read the post if you have the time, it's funny because I was so desperate back then too.

This anxiety was so intense, that I don't think how I could make it without covid shutdowns literally, I don't know my head would have freaking exploded

This is not normal anxiety, I've read countless of posts back then in 2020 about this. 99% I've seen that people with a anxiety disorder have general anxiety about just everything, and it seems focused towards that.

The thing with me is that Idk, it's something I call ""enviromental anxiety"", everytime I'm outside, look outside I get a spike of anxiety, even in my house it spikes due to specific lightning and stuff - which makes it so calming down is so difficult, I also seem to get stuck in this such bad headspace, like this recent spike started 8 days ago. yes. 8 days ago. This lasted for 4 months during the 2020 period, from around September-December 2020, and during that time it was like 4 bad days - 3 decent days, but still awful compared to how I was before my recent wave.

Now the craziest thing is this started 8 days ago as I've said. I've also had it in 2020, but after that, in 2021 I had basically 0 waves, even if there were any they weren't anywhere near as major and they happened at the start of 2021. 2022 I had 0 waves, 2023 I had a wave at the start which also made me panicky as all shit, here's my discord messages in a discord server from then: [https://ibb.co/fdcnF2pq](https://ibb.co/fdcnF2pq) as you see back then I was also desperate, I do not remember how long it lasted but it was like a few days, max 4 I think.

Then after that for the entirety of 2023 there was nothing, 2024 there was nothing, 2025 up until now it's nothing.

I've never seen this before, even when thinking about these thoughts or whatever when I thought about the 2020 periods during these periods of no anxiety there was 0 anxiety thinking about the said thing, like it didn't spike from me thinking about it.

In the last 4 years and a half i've literally had bad days that could be counted on 2 hands maximum up until now.

I'm just so confused in what the fuck it is, like I'm pretty sure it's anxiety. but like what? Like I hope you get me.

I've literally gone from being able to laugh to teary eyed a week and a half ago, to being like borderline depressed in like a day.

Like 2 weeks before the said wave hit I had 0 depression, I felt completely different like a 180, I lost weight in 2023 from being overweight, I started going to the gym in 2024, got a very good physique in the last year and a half, started a business, got a girlfriend, for the first time went to a different city countries away without my parents only my gf (I'm 21), and wanted to pursue education in last quarter of 2025 countiuing into 2026

Like this what I'm feeling right now, was unbelievable that it could happen, even if I tried to like actively get it, like even if I thought about it affecting me again, I couldn't have got it.

Now I have no idea what triggered it, like literally nada. Maybe it was specific lightning or something that the time reminded me of that in such a specific way.

And I just can't seem to calm down, even when I calm down a little bit, there's a little bit of like ""fuck like this enviromental anxiety is a fucking bitch"" and I look outside and idk, it just spikes up again.

When it goes to high levels I literally get in such a bad headspace, I literally feel like I'm going to go crazy, like I can't hide, like there's no safe space, it feels so incredibly overwhelming and it reminded me again of how fucking hard this shit is. I literally cannot do shit right now. My gym motivation has went to almost a 0, my business aspirations went to almost a 0, my wish to educate myself went to a 0. this happened in literally a day. it seems that this emotion, whatever I'm experiencing right now is so intense that it literally breaks me, feel like I can't do shit until it passes.

As I've said waves normally last 4-5 days, this one started monday last week, but I think I triggered it Sunday because I remember already being in a weirder anxious headspace then at night - I remember it getting worse because I was scared of losing everything I've worked for the last years, I was like holy shit my girlfriend is going to go, I'll not be able to run my business, I won't be able to pursue education. It went down in Thursday, I checked the mental health discord server and I saw that I was that desperate in 2023 as seen above, and it calmed me a lot, literally 70-80% calmness, and then on friday it was close to disappearing, it was like 85-90% gone espacially when I went on a date and then when we came back to my place, I remember again feeling this weird fucking enviromental anxiety, and it was worse than it was at day, but still not bad bad. and then saturday it hit me like a fucking truck again, and on sunday I was at my girlfriend's aunt's birthday party it was better, and then at night it hits me like a truck. again. today whole day was basically very bad. It's been 8 days now, and it scares me. will this be gone? How come I can't calm down from this wave, and I feel like I fucking can't, like if everything triggers this awful headspace, how do I escape this headspace? Will I just calm down and get out of this headspace? It seems that every thought triggers this headspace - not exactly but like I think about being in this headspace and then the next thought triggers it.

It's just so fucked. Mind you less than 2 weeks ago I could have never thought of this happening again I am literally the goofy guy I make people laugh, this started in 2020, it was shitty from September - December during that period. Had maybe one or two waves start of 2021, nothing major. and then a single sole wave in january of 2023. After that I've had nothing. In the last 2 years and a half I've had 0 of this headspace feeling/wave

I don't have any childhood trauma, I didn't experience any abuse, I don't have any trauma in general, but I don't know if what happened back in 2020 counts as trauma as I was completely broken back then too - but y'know.

I'd honestly climb up to the sky right now to find out why I triggered it and what is this and why it puts me in such a headspace at times, when it gets very bad during these waves that I feel literally definition of hopeless, and not like ""I took this exam and I'm hopeless on it's result"" It's like I'm literally hopeless on how this will get better, on how in the heck will I find a safe space in my head, and how will I manage this - it literally feels so hopeless that I feel like my mind will literally break.

Sometimes during this I get calmer, and I get really happy. Like when it calmed down by a lot on friday, I was so freaking happy, I remember that in the restaurant I was laughing and stuff like It's going to be gone soon, and then on saturday again with the same ol'l bullshit."
30,2,"I think I do pretty well, considering.  And I hate to be “that girl who had those things happen to her”.  It’s been a few years.  I should be okay by now.  

I don’t talk about it to anyone.  I’m tired of talking about it.  Talking about it doesn’t make it better.  It doesn’t undo anything.  I’m tired of talking about it.  

But damn.  Does anyone else break in the quiet moments? Like driving alone in a car and your brain just wanders and starts thinking about those things? Or waking up in the middle of the night and your head is full of them? 

But, now… I’m okay if I’m preoccupied or with other people.  I’m a happy person and I like myself.   I have a lot of hobbies I enjoy.  I’ve always been very private and introverted.  To be honest, I like that about me and I’d never change it.  I enjoy other people and I’m very friendly, but… I get overwhelmed easily and need to just chill by myself a bit.  I gain energy from having time to myself.  Etc.  classic introvert.  

Since part of my brain kinda broke… that’s the only way I can describe it.  I have a hard time in the quiet moments.  Driving in the car alone, I just start thinking about things and I get angry all over again.  I listen to very loud rap music (I’m slightly hard of hearing and to me it’s not all that loud… lol) but nothing drowns out those thoughts.  

Middle of the night? When I know it’ll still be a few hours before I can allow myself to properly get up and arrange my dolls in fun scenes or read a book I’m really enjoying, or even watch cartoons? 

It is those quiet moments, when I can’t distract myself that I actually feel just so incredibly broken.  

Anyone else have trouble in the quiet moments? "
31,2,"Someone jumped through my window and didn't hit me or hurt me, but he said he would kill me. It was over a dispute. I was completely taken off guard and very scared, but it's over. My friend mentioned that you can develop PTSD from that. I've been a bit worried about it since and do feel myself get nervous when I hear the door open and worried about it. What does developing PTSD look like, and how do you prevent it? what is the likelihood you get it with an event like that?"
32,2,"


I recently had someone I thought was my friend say we never vibed.

I know I am very lucky to have some long distance friends who are very understanding, but I feel like every day is a knew breakdown for me and I keep having the same problems over and over. I don’t feel like therapy is enough. I haven’t gotten better in years and I know it’s hard to watch. I just don’t feel like I have that person who I know I can count on, I mean it’s not like I can’t count on my friends, it’s just that they are busy people not to mention that the one that left was the only friend I had that also has PTSD. 

Do other people feel this way? Is it also hard to find the energy to interact with people? 

Side note I also have Autism, but I feel like I was better at masking before my trauma got really set off."
33,1,"I won't go into detail, but a year ago my own poor choices led me to being in a situation I was being assaulted everyday for a month. It ended with being threatened with a gun, I made my escape with my kids and saved us. That doesn't make me feel any better.

I'm in week 10 of CPT (Cognitive Processing Therapy) but I feel ill never be normal again. I feel no happiness, I used to talk and be enthusiastic about life. I find i have nothing to say anymore. I just want to sleep forever, I can't do anything I know I should.

 I'm stuck and feel alone in this. 

Where can I find support for this? I can't be the only one."
34,2,"I’ve been seeing my psychologist and we haven’t started emdr but it’s just been a lot of talking and digging deep into what triggers started my hypervigilance and ptsd. And maybe where that comes from like a lot of talk about my childhood and my family and trauma and perfectionism issues, and just keeping the weight of the world on my shoulders. Sometimes I feel like I’ll always have ptsd though. Like I just have to carry this with me everyday and it makes life so much harder. Like sometimes I don’t feel like myself and I feel agitated more than before and I’m not someone who ever feels agitated. And sounds are louder and my vision gets more HD. Then I’ll have constant symptoms but even at times before I do something that used to cause me baseline anxiety, now that thing will cause my muscle to tense up subconsciously and my body won’t stop muscle spasming especially at night. I guess I just feel sad and a little hopeless, like am I always gonna feel like this. And I said to her that I wish that I could be the person I was before this started, and she said I could never be that person again but I’ll be someone else who know had this experience and learnt from it. And I get what she’s saying but I guess I just wanted more reassurance if it could go away. It’s just so exhausting. Like everyone can just live the way they live and then I just have all these symptoms that come with me everywhere I go, yet only I suffer from them since it’s not noticeable to others. Sometimes my life feels like I’m killing myself slowly I guess, I don’t feel healthy so how can I actually be healthy. But I know I am it’s just the hypervigilance. This is so tiring "
35,2,"(Cross posted by me from another sub) I’m 22. Not gonna go into a lot of detail, but basically I was assaulted by an acquaintance/past sexual partner I had over on my 3rd night in my apartment, before  my friend and roomie moved in. The worst part is that his permeant address is also a few miles from where my parents live (they live about 25 min away from me).

I feel uneasy both in my apartment and in my parents home when I feel alone/am alone.

I don’t think this will all go away with a simple move, but could it help? It would be a lot of work, I’d have to find a new suitable roommate for my friend who I live with and also find somewhere else I could live. 

I probably can’t move out of the area I live in as I kinda need my parents for support, but I have a pretty strong desire to move about an hour south of where I live now, as I’ve wanted to try living there for a few years anyway. 

If I stay in this apartment I’ll be there till next May."

38,2,"CW: Mentions of war.
(Not sure if I should use it but just in case)

I was never in the middle of the war, but I had to live in a country where rockets, terrorist attacks and mass murders happened every other week. I hear the sirens even when it's quiet, I can't wear both headphones, I have nightmares, hallucinations, flashbacks.
The doctor keeps saying that it affects everyone, that everyone is stressed, but it never leaves me. Every sound in the night scares me, but they say that I had to participate in the war or be affected directly, like have my house ruined because of a missile, so they just put in a different type of PTSD because I have another one of those serious traumas. They never take it seriously, no matter where I go, but I have panic attacks when something sounds like a siren, I can only think about the missiles, the attacks. They never believe me, and I seriously have no idea what to do at this point. Only one psychiatrist diagnosed me with this PTSD, but every single one afterwards just ignored it. I guess it's because of my anxiety disorders, but it just doesn't feel like my usual anxiety, it's much more intense and never leaves me, unlike my other fears that can come and go. 

Am I being dramatic? I feel like I'm going insane because of this, because I have no idea if something is truly wrong with me, or if it's just my anxiety. I have to mention that the same things happen with my other trauma - same panic attacks, flashbacks, nightmares and the topic never leaving my head. I don't get hallucinations with it because my other trauma isn't really about sounds. My usual anxiety doesn't involve anything of the above except for panic attacks, which is the main reason I realized that it might be a war-related trauma. I could really use some advice about how I approach the conversation with my psychiatrist, because I really struggle with starting conversations about serious topics.

Important:
 don't expect anyone to tell me if it's PTSD or not, I know that only my doctor can diagnose me. I just need advice from people who maybe also struggled with getting their diagnosis because of their other disorders.

She and I have been married for twenty years. She knows everything about me and my past. I was dumbfounded that she would think that was a good fucking idea. Im still beyond fucking pissed that she would set that expectation with my kids and honestly if it weren't for them Id be packing my things to leave right now.

Onto my point.. i’ve been sleeping in my new house for about three nights now, but even still, i get overwhelming anxiety that my ex is going to break in and try to hurt me. Is this normal? Am I overreacting? I know the locks are pretty sturdy, but every noise keeps me on edge and I just want to know if these feelings will ever go away. I think i just need reassurance 😭"
43,1,I have TW SI >!Im sitting at 17 attempts and they were bad!< I sometimes think back when it's quiet. More often recently about the past. Anyone else also made added to their ptsd with this? 
44,1,"[28F] I have complex PTSD. I've dealt with everything from growing up in an abusive household, caring for my father as a child when he had cancer, growing up too quickly to raise my immigrant parents, abusive relationships, abusive siblings, and loss of loved ones.

I've just been unlucky I guess. Every year or so, something happens to me. Derails my life and plans. 

Most recently, my bestfriend since childhood started dating my ex and I've cut out my longest friend group because they all support her and my feelings are invalidated.

So I'm trying to make new friends and find new love but it's so hard. 

I'm beginning to realize that I overshare because trauma, abuse, and betrayal has always been my normal. 

I try my absolute fucking hardest to understand, and be kind to every person I meet. But I've discovered not everyone is understanding of my problems and past. And I keep getting hurt by people who turn away when I've opened up. 

I have 0 close friends right now. I've gathered a small pinch of new friends that I've just begun to know. Maybe a few guys that I'm interested in. 

I'm scared to talk with this fear that I'll scare people away. I'm afraid that people will think I'm less than an adult bcus of how behind I am in life due to my traumas. 

It's not my fault for everything that's happened to me. I don't know what to say when I'm asked ""How's it going?"" Because everything is going on. Idk what to share or what to talk about. "
45,3,I need help. I had a lot happen to me as a kid that I can't fathom getting into right now. Not in this state of mind. I'm not thinking about THAT but my brain is going a mile a minute and I feel like I need to run or scream or punch a brick wall or do drugs for no reason type energy. I'm not all that of a risky impulsive person but does any else get moods like this? Like I don't sleep but my head is still running on redbull and I feel on the tip of emotion and I need to cry and scream and laugh all at once. It feels like I have untamed energy I have so much potential with. I know I'm gonna crash and get hella depressed it happens every now and then but I haven't cracked the code on what to do. I'm scared of the crash because I know I'm gonna end up in a shame hole regretting every choice and hating my life and all that comes with remembering things I'd rather not. I've overcome bad coping habits but I don't have anything else. I'm in an unsupportive environment that makes a lot worse and I can just barely hide that I'm ready to jump off a cliff for the thrill. I just feel screaming in my head. I don't have anywhere to go and I don't have people that get it. I'm worried about myself at this point which I saying a lot bc I've experienced this shit since I was 14. I don't really want to get locked away anywhere but what do I do to make things slow down? Please anyone help out or at least let me know you go through this too. This feeling like you want to fight someone for kicks or you want to get beaten up to feel something I don't know...
46,0,"I have a few specific memories of things so bad my therapist said they terrified her. Before then I hadn't thought of them as really bad. It was just something that happened. My reaction to trauma has always been ""well that happened, it is what it is."" Hyper-vigilance and other outcomes are simply a natural consequence of trauma. Bad things happened, I got PTSD, and so here I am. Only when my therapist freaked out did I realize I was supposed to be upset about it.

We considered EMDR for them, but I could tell she was intimidated, and anyway I don't feel emotions about them. To me they are part of my biography, like the name of my high school or the street name where I lived. They evoke no more emotion than that.

I did have some memories with emotion (mostly betrayal or friend loss) which we did EMDR on. But I got nothing on these. 

Is it worth it to try to ""stimulate"" these memories? Or should I leave them be?"
47,2,"I’ve been seeing a occupational therapist for a little over a year now and while we haven’t made loads of progress i still really value the work she’s done to help me in the thing she specialises in. I’ve continued seeing her because clicked really well when I was getting ketamine therapy and she was to first person who I told I was trans that I wasn’t sleeping with, she also really helped me with my transition(mtf). But a few months ago i started having a really tough time dealing with certain trauma, she was also the first person i told as an adult and while she has been trying to help I can’t help but notice she’s trying to get me to see someone else. At first it was finding support groups then letting me know she won’t be able to attend our next session and recommending therapist for me, I know she doesn’t specialise in my problems but I don’t really want to see anyone else. I’ve had a few emdr appointments and I fucking hate it, I don’t want to know anything I just want to talk about what was difficult last week and what I can do to avoid those problems and work on organisational stuff. I know it’s not fair to her and I’ve tried to have more sessions about work stuff and I haven’t gone into detail about what happened but I still know she wants me to see someone else. Idk im in a weird spot "
48,3,"**That Feeling**  
My name is Isak, and I am not alone. Every day, when I think I am safe, I feel a breath down my neck. When I try to run, it follows. When I try to ignore it, it gets louder. I can’t escape it, but I can’t let it consume me either. Sometimes it makes me angry and frustrated. It makes me want to rip my walls down and scream. Yet, when the anger storms are over, it is still there.

It has been so long that it has changed me. I now feel more protective—but is the person I have become truly me, or is it him? Whenever it gets too close, too strong, I just feel like a little boy again. I try to live my life, but whenever someone resembles it, it gets stronger and bigger. I fear that it will soon swallow me whole.

The angrier I get, the louder and more aggressive I become—the closer I am to being like him. But I don’t want to. I can’t let myself do that. So what will I do? I feel trapped, like I’m in a maze with no end.

What if, instead of running, instead of pretending it’s not there—I accept that it is there and don’t let it control me?  
Maybe then, I can finally be free.

  
i not to good at talking about it just normal so i wrote a story instead hope its ok "

Is it possible to give ptsd to yourself? I have multiple flashbacks and thoughts of diffrent events 
Sexual trauma in highschool 
Trauma childhood (severe bullying, stalker, boy who hit me all the time.) 
But lately the trauma is about an episode I had in 2020, I've been self harming since I was around nine, and severely starting at fourteen. Anyway in 2020 I had what I can only describe as a psychotic episode. I had to self harm rows on my body everyday going over them. I had to purge eight times to ""save my family from the voices and universe."" I didn't shower cause I would be scared it would wash away the ""evidence."" I had multiple sucide attempts and eve  remember sort of oding in the bathroom. 
I used to vomit when I was done self harming it would hurt my body that much. Anyway I get severe flashbacks thoughts I think about it all day it won't get out of my head. So is it possible I littrally traumatized myself? I recently had a psychology evaluation and it said  scezophernia levels were elevated and has treats. Does anyone know what that means? "
51,0,"Hi everyone! I recently saw a post on here where someone mentioned a Samsung watch which after establishing baseline biometrics was able to alert the wearer when they were beginning to experience an acute episode so they could begin coping techniques early. 

I did some reading and I thing the oura ring would suit me better for various reasons, but sadly I'm not independently wealthy, so I wanted to ask the community if anyone had any off brand recommendations? 

I'm looking for something that offers longitudinal metrics (long term recording of biometrics) that are monitored passively (i.e. don't need to he manually entered, they're monitored in the background), and has a predictive algorithm that can alert the wearer preemptively about a ptsd episode. Ideally with advanced metric tracking like skin temperature, HRV, SpO₂, etc. 

I know this is kind of an unusual question but hopefully someone has solved this one already 

Thanks in advance everybody "
52,1,"I (24F) find it really difficult to articulate or process why I have ptsd, and explain it to others. It’s all really mixed up in my head and it makes me feel no one will ever be able to love me.

A couple of things happened as a child: when I was 5 a child touched me inappropriately in front of my classmates, then the same year I was in a horrific car accident and a doctor touched me innapropriately. I suffered severe depression from the age of 11. I was groomed online and sent a lot of nudes to pedos, and I was regularly bullied and slut shamed at school. My bullying included being followed home and beaten up by boys.

Most of my trauma happened in the past 2 years though. Basically I was cheated on and kicked out onto the streets by my ex and the girl she cheated with. In the weeks leading up to this the two of them repeatedly tried to have me sectioned, calling police into my home etc on multiple occasions without telling me what was going on. The “other woman” would take me aside and shout at me telling me my girlfriend hated me, I was a burden on everyone and everyone just wanted me gone. When I became homeless, I overdosed and spent a week in hospital. That week was one of the most terrifying of my life, I can barely remember any of it but I remember I was in an IV and there was a lot happening and I was terrified. At the time I was so underweight I could barely walk to the end of my street, so the overdose had affected me really bad as I was already really ill.

As soon as I got out of hospital, I came across a group of middle aged homeless guys living in a bando, shooting up all day. There was a room available and I slept on the floor. Occasionally women would come through but I could hear them being abused through the wall. I lived with them for a few months but I barely slept the entire time, I was hyper vigilant. But I was just grateful for somewhere to sleep. At some point a new man came by cos he needed somewhere to stay, he was just out of prison. The guys made me share my room with him. I refused, so I left. 

I made contact with an old friend I used to live with who lived in the same city. We went out for drinks and he let me stay at his house. It was the first time I’d felt safe in months. When we went back, he gave me a line of ket, which was so strong it sent me straight into a K hole and I was unable to move. I remember Rick and Morty was playing on the TV and in my brain I completely thought I was in the show - I was basically lying unconscious. At some point I realised that he was on top of me and inside me. I wanted it to stop but I couldn’t move. I was just fallling in and out of consciousness, in a constant state of confusion and pain. When I woke up in the morning, he was gone cos he left at 6am to go work on a building site. I got the fuck out of his house and never spoke to him again.

Through some people I knew, I found a new bando which was inhabited by 6 trans girls and they’d sell weed out of it. While I was living there I had a string of violent and traumatic sexual experiences. Then weird things started happening that I didn’t know if I was imagining or not, I didn’t know whether or not I was in psychosis. One girl, who had previously taken me under her wing until she got what she wanted (sex) told me I needed to leave as I was being too much of a burden on everyone. 

When I left, I tried to rekindle my friendship with the people I’d lived with when I was with my ex who’d kicked me out. At this point I was doing a lot of drugs. My ex had moved her new girlfriend into my room and as soon as I came back the “other woman” who I’d only met once or twice, called the cops and took me to the hospital to have me sectioned. She told the doctors she was my only friend and she’s had me on suicide watch for months and she just can’t look after me anymore (she didn’t fucking know me). I wasn’t sectioned and she yelled at me in the car park to get the fuck out of all their lives. 

At this point I began sofa surfing, with somewhere to sleep if there was a free bed for the night, riding around on buses to kill time. I fell in with a group of local guys who were on crack and who hung around outside corner shops. I vaguely knew them through my ex. They were nice to me but I later found out that two of them were planning to gang rape me, but decided against it once they realised who my ex was (she would give them a lot of money and hide them from the cops and stuff, so they didn’t wanna make an enemy of her). 

Around this time I became a sex worker. I fell into it, and started off doing some seriously dodgy shit. I was doing full service work for around a year, and I think a lot of it was quite traumatic. The type of men who pay for sex are not good people. During that year I dated two people. In both cases I knew them for a long time, and had built up a level of trust. They knew I was sexually traumatised and were very kind to me. In both cases, they became cold and immmediately stopped speaking to me once we had sex. One of these people had been my best friend. Then about 9 months ago I was raped by a guy I went on a first date with. 

I went celibate for about 3 months and was going to church a lot. I was doing DBT therapy and it helped a lot. In my local music scene I met a guy who was sweet, beautiful, kind and shy. He was a trans guy, and he wasn’t misogynistic in any way. He was a virgin as dysphoria made sex very difficult for him, and I told him about my traumas from the beginning. We took things really slow and it was great for us both. Our love and our sex was so sweet, pure, intimate. It was the first time I truly felt safe with a partner. We were together like 5 months. My mental health was good. 

However one night I began to show signs of ptsd. I was having flashbacks, panicking, feeling unsafe. I asked him not to film me or call the cops on me. He went home. He didn’t speak to me for days. When we met up he said no part of him wants to be with “someone like that”. I made him feel unsafe. He didn’t recognise me. He said the trust was completely gone. I tried to explain to him that I’m still the same person that loves him and treats him well. He said it’s over. I haven’t seen him in a month. It’s completely solidified to me that this affliction means I can never find love. I was so strong, and after one moment of weakness he left. I thought I was better, I thought I could live like a normal person. I think maybe my level of trauma is just too much, like I’m a lost cause. But it’s weird because it still doesn’t feel like I’ve been through enough, I guess maybe because not one singular thing happened to me that I can pinpoint.
"
53,2,"Background: I have worked in healthcare for the last 6 years. I became an EMT and was a volunteer firefighter a month after I got my EMT license. The pandemic kicked off and I left the fire department to go help out with my state. I signed up with the state government medical assistance teams and was deployed throughout my state for 3 years assisting hospitals, field hospitals, and care centers that were affected by covid. I then went out of the country for a few medical contracts and went down to the southern border to medically screen people crossing through. I then worked on an ambulance and then in a emergency department closer to home when I first met my wife. I have been working in the ER as a ER technician for the last 3 years. 

  
Main rant: I have been working in healthcare for the last 6 years and have witnessed and experienced a lot of traumatic loss both 2nd hand and personally during that time. I have lost friends due to S\*\*\*ide and have lost coworkers that I was close with due to freak accidents. I have pushed all of these feelings down for years because I have been trying to push through and do my job. I did not allow myself to feel sad or grief much at all over the last 6 years. I started having panic attacks and depression the last few years and I had a really bad case at work that ended up with a patient passing away while a family member watched. I still hear the screams sometimes and have had nightmares that wake me up reliving the events I have witnessed throughout my career. 

  
I got some good news the other day and got a job in a healthcare adjacent field (basically office and clerical work) so no more working in emergency settings. I noticed how relieved I was to get out of the field but what I really noticed was this overwhelming sense of emotion. I think repressing everything for the last 6 years is finally catching up to me. Memories that i pushed out of my head are coming back and I relive them in my dreams. I was at the end of my rope so I talked with my wife and we reached out to my doctor and I am about to see a therapist, group therapy, and talk to a psychiatrist about getting some help. 

I guess I just feel scared. I feel on edge and I just want to be happy and not be triggered all the time. I guess this is more of a rant than asking advice. I just needed to get this off my chest. I feel like if I posted all of the trauma I am processing right now I would be here all day. 

One lesson I am learning from all of this is that I should have seeked help a LONG time ago. Waiting to get help after 6 years of trauma has changed who I am as a person. I am hoping I can salvage what I have left and learn to live with what has happened. If you took the time to read this I want to say thank you, and I hope whatever you are going through you are trying to get help. "
54,2,I went on several scary roller coasters today and it's time for me to go to bed and I'm hallucinating everything shaking. What do I do?
55,1,"
Does anyone else feel this way? I can’t recall anything that happened to me before my rape, nor do I recognize the people I knew before it. I see people’s faces and slightly know them, but I can’t fully comprehend it. It feels so weird. I don’t even know where or who I am sometimes. My level of perception is so off. 

A lot of people who have had near death experiences recall that immediately after they died, they saw themselves (their soul) floating around while their physical body stayed stiff and cold. They observed everything differently. That’s exactly what I go through now. It feels like I died and I don’t exist anymore, or I feel on the brink of death for some reason. I’m always on edge. 

I graduated college a month ago and don’t recognize my diplomas or what subjects I studied. My memories of those 4 years are gone. There is a before and after of my rape incident. It’s so harrowing that a lot of people who know me have no idea what I went through recently and perceive me based on the past. Who I was before my rape doesn’t exist anymore. I don’t exist anymore.

57,2,"Me (15 female) have had a really weird experience when I was 6 years old, I tried talking about it with a few of my therapists but they just said things like 'I'm sorry that happened to you' and never really tried talking about it.

I find myself thinking about it a lot but no one has ever helped me to try to understand what was it and what even happened

When I was 6 years old, my grandma had to look after me a lot of times as my mum was away for work or sick. And on multiple occasions while we were together, either in the house alone or with my mum sleeping in the bedroom, she would perform inappropriate acts with people on the phone, right next to me. Or she would watch such explicit things with me.

It really grosses me out, she's my family, my literal grandma. Taking advantage of the fact I was too young to understand what it was and consent, (when now that I can, I absolutely would not that's disgusting) I really don't understand why anyone would do that to a child, from what I remember she never touched me inappropriately, but did hit me.

 Does anyone know what this is and why people do it? I'm very confused"

A man, about 35-40 years old, approached me about a product. I helped him and then wanted to move on when he asked me for my phone number. I said no and he asked again and again and practically held his phone in front of my face. He said that he and his friends were going to fuck me and that I could get drunk beforehand so I wouldn't feel anything. I was disgusted, just kept walking and kept saying I wasn't interested. Then he grabbed my arm quite tightly and pulled me toward him, placing his other hand on my sternum. The fact that he grabbed me and held me, coupled with the skin-to-skin contact on my chest, totally triggered me and I couldn't move. I literaly could feel the emptiness in my brain and that it could not process it right now. Then he put his hand on the side of my neck and started choking me. He went harder and harder with it and I don't know why, but the choking brought me back to reality and made me want to break free. I yelled at him that he shouldn‘t treat people like that and what he was thinking choking young women in the supermarket just because they didn't want to have sex with him and his friends.

63,3,"When I feel triggered or threatened, I get into these anger rages where I dissociate and become destructive. I also have obsessive thinking. Where if I am triggered by something, the thought/feelings/anger does not leave my head and nothing can calm me of it or stop the obsessive thoughts. 

I have tried medications in the past and my medical history is too complex that I don't know what psychiatric medication to be on because alot of them interact with other current medication, or I'm at increased risk of certain side effects because of complex medical history.
I have tried numerous SSRI's antidepressants(Zoloft for example) in the past and they have all given me hallucinations. (on the Lowest dose, 1 pill). (Hallucinations stopped once medication left my system)

I am in trauma focused therapy like EMDR and talk-therapy.  But these therapists cannot prescribe meds and I do not currently have a psychiatrist. 
I guess I am just wondering if anyone here also experiences dissociative-type of anger rages and obsessive thoughts like i explained. And if you do, what do you do to control them ?

There were two major events.
One when I was a little child. My mother’s boyfriend. He came into our home. I let him in because I didn’t know any better. I was alone. He touched me. He tried to go further. I froze. I got away before it got “worse” — but it was already too much. It was already rape, even if my child mind didn’t have that word.
I went into the kitchen afterward and stared at nothing. I remember trying not to cry.
My mom came home later and said “don’t let anyone in again.” She had no idea. I never told her.
I went to play like nothing happened.
I buried the memory so deep it didn’t resurface until recently.
But now it won’t stop.

Then, years later, It happened again by a stranger in a public bathroom while abroad.
He pushed me in, locked the door, covered my mouth. He didn’t speak, just hushed me like I was some crying child. He had a camera.
I remember the floor.
I remember blood.
I remember not being able to breathe.
And then I remember nothing.
But the damage had already been done.

Now I’m remembering it all at once.
My body remembers first — in pain, in shaking, in nausea.
Then come the pictures, the flashes.
Then the shame. The unbearable shame. Not to talk about the terror. I get stuck in flashbacks and panic attacks for hours at a time.

I feel like I’m unraveling.
Like I can’t hold myself together anymore.
Like there is poison inside my chest.
I want to scream.
I want to disappear.
I want it all to stop.

I hate that I didn’t tell anyone. I hate that I protected the people who broke me.
I hate that I’m still alive , because it still hurts every day.
And sometimes— I still doubt myself. I still hear a voice saying, or i fear someone says. 
“Your making it all up for attention.”
“They are never gonna believe you.”

But I’m not.
I know I’m not.
I wish someone would hold my face and tell me: You didn’t deserve it. You’re not lying. You’re not disgusting.
But the damage has already been done.
One word, one sight, one touch, one smell. 
And I’m back in the room, stuck, him being able to do whatever he wants with me.

So I’m saying it here because I need someone — anyone — to hear me.

If you’ve survived something like this:
How do you live with the memories?
How do you go on, when the past keeps pulling you down like an anchor around your throat?
How do you manage, even a little bit? 

Because I’m tired.
I’m so, so tired.

And still — I’m here.
Writing this.
Breathing.

66,2,"Just been recently diagnosed with autism. I've had cptsd for some time but it's just strange. All this time growing up trying to understand whats wrong with me. Nothing is wrong with me. I was just traumatized and needed help.

There are days even weeks sometimes where I'll disassociate and it feels like I'm not real. I live in a cage of my own mind, feel like I have to apologize every day. I over explain my behavior just for the hope someone will understand. But I've learned some people genuinely don't care. Parents and ex spouse included. 

This gives me some sense of normalcy knowing what's going on.. Just going to take time to heal and understand myself."
67,1,"Hello,

I’m going to ask a question regarding something that has bothered me for 2 decades, and I would like to hear your thoughts on it.

When I was about a year old, I was involved in an accident where I was badly burnt. I required a long stay at a specialized hospital and had to undergo surgery; a blood transfusion and skin graft.

Although I can’t remember the events, I bear a large scar on my body which has caused chronic psychological stress.

When I became a teenager, I started to become more aware of what I had endured. From there, I began experiencing severe bouts of depression and emotional outbursts. It started to hit me, “Wow. I really have these big scars on my body.” 

Every time I see the scars, it’s like my heart starts beating faster. 

In my household, it was never really discussed, and every time I attempted to talk about it, I would start to cry.

For years, I was angry at my caregivers for this happening, despite it being an accident.

When I became a young man, I started reflecting on my own thought patterns and realized that I’d spent most of my life viewing myself as ‘less-than’ society, and I held a deep shame for having such scars. 

Everything in my power is done to conceal them.

Because I view myself as unworthy, I find it almost impossible to form relationships with people and will often sabotage them in an effort to maintain distance.

Is it possible that this event has caused life-long PTSD, or some other psychological disorder?

For years, I’ve felt as though something isn’t right and I often feel it stems from this one incident.

I am not looking for a diagnosis, I am simply looking for someone to shed some light on my thoughts. 

What can I do?

And can an incident which you can’t recall cause psychological harm?

Thanks."
68,1,"To preface, I do take an interest in others, initiate most of the time, ask questions, and try to make sure there's a level of reciprocity. I was isolated by my parents and peers growing up and only had online friendships to cope with the situation. 

But it always seems to just stroke other peoples egos who don't ever invite me to anything or initiate conversations on their end. When they will literally light up as soon as anyone else shows up and does the same things you were doing. What the fuck is so fundamentally wrong with me?

No one seems to give me a chance and always has their cliques and previous friends who take precedence even when they are actively harming and sabotaging the person you're trying to be friends with and everyone would label me a ""retard"" or ""random"" out of nowhere and would never take my side on anything. Every time I see someone making art ""for a friend"" it just makes me jealous and triggers memories of being excluded and banned for no reason."

Every night while I (18F) am trying to fall asleep, I get these images as soon as I close my eyes. They’re always either memories or fictional scenarios in which it’s happening again or where it’s my fault. It happened when we were 11 and as much as I’ve recovered, it still comes back to haunt me consistently. He’s my twin brother, and it’s impossible to hate him for it enough to cut him off and ruin my family, but sometimes it just becomes too much. I have these nightmares almost every night where it’s happening in different ways and often times i’m the one who initiates it in the dreams. It makes me sick, and also makes me scared that it was my fault because I let it happen. I talk about it with my therapist when I feel able and my parents know but I can’t bring it up any more or with any additional details because I don’t want them to blame themselves more or hate him on my behalf. I have a boyfriend who knows everything about me, except for this one thing. He knows vaguely that something happened at that point in my life but not who did it. I don’t know if I’ll ever tell him, because I don’t want him to view my family or brother differently, or feel uncomfortable or even violent being around him. As horrible as what my brother did is, he was a kid and cares about me and I know he would never do anything like it again, not to me or to anyone else. I know he regrets it, which is good, but also makes it so much more confusing and impossible to recover from. I have never been able to understand what made him think it was an okay idea. It honestly pisses me off that he has so many friends who know nothing about it, and that I have to live my life being the only one with the knowledge of all those details and all the images forever engrained in my mind. I know this is kind of a pointless tangent but I’m so sick of keeping it all in and having no one who can truly hear me and know what I have to deal with. I dissociate every time I try to talk about it or process my feelings, and it’s happening right now so I don’t even know what else to add anymore. I’m just so tired of not getting restful sleep and of feeling ashamed for something that i know deep down wasn’t my fault and of no one i care about knowing what I’m dealing with underneath everything else.

70,2,"My vote goes to the scene in Terminator 2 where Sarah recounts a recurring nightmare, and her talking about the dream makes her spiral and freak out. Her body posture, quick emotional shifts from numbness to crying hysterically and then to rage and white hot fear. It all hits close to home for me. Youtube video of the scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXD12XrttmQ"
71,3,"I’ve been struggling for years with this issue and I’m in the ending stages of my divorce and this man has made it 1000x harder than it needed to be. I’ve got a lot of trauma from being in corrections and this abusive relationship, and I’m just a huge mess. 

I don’t mean to perceive everything as a threat. It goes towards anyone and everyone in my life. I’m spinning on a carousel of agonizing rage and it won’t slow down. It feels like it’s been more rampant. 

I’m highly irritable and just ready to explode at the drop of a pin. I see red and then I see nothing. I don’t remember a lot when I get this angry. I’m not physically violent towards anyone. I admit I’ve made holes in my parents walls before I found myself an apartment recently. I feel awful. I’m ashamed. My kid hasn’t seen a lot of these outbursts but she’s seen a few. She’s 8 and I don’t want this for her. She’s already dealing with a father that isn’t present in her life. She doesn’t need a mother that’s a wreck like this. 

I had a therapist and psychiatrist, but I dropped them. And I don’t know why. It was before their prices went up so that’s not why. I just kind of give up and get mad wasting my time. I know I shouldn’t see it as a waste. I obviously need some help. 

What steps can I take to step back? Stop myself from taking one step too far? My mind always goes to the extremes and I’m unsure how to process everything alone anymore. I do have friends and a new partner that have been helping me, but I know that I cannot rely on them. They aren’t specialists. 

I do not know all of my triggers yet. I keep finding new ones. I feel boxed in often and I know that’s a major one for me. 

I just need help. My mind needs to be at ease for once. My body needs to relax and I can’t. I’m always on edge. I’m hyper vigilant. Paranoid and anxious. And there’s just times I can’t control myself. 

Alcohol, weed - negative. Can’t turn to those. Gets ugly and I’m not into self medicating anymore. I’m trying to heal, not end up in a cell. 

I want to be well. I want to be normal. I want to be happy. I don’t want to be angry. I don’t want to rage. I don’t want to hurt anyone or anything anymore. "
72,0,"I (20M) have been dating my girlfriend (19F) for the last six months, and as cliché as it sounds, i absolutely love her, and i have never been happier in my entire life. I can't even put into words how much meeting her has helped me with my own problems, all i can say is that i genuinely want to protect this girl.

I knew about her PTSD before we even started dating, and it was actually something that helped our bounding over the months. Her trauma comes from childhood abuse from her mother (of which long story short, tried to kill her and herself in a psicosis episode, way more than a single time.), and since i also share a very similar background, i could instantly relate and care for everything she went through. But it affected her in a way more visceral manner (severe depression, extremely low self-esteem, strong mood swings, etcetera) 

I try my best to help her, and i genuinely want to make her as happy as i possibly can, the only issue is that, sometimes i feel like i don't do ""enough""? I never judge her for her feelings or reactions, i listen to her and i always try my best to give her comfort, yet i'm pretty sure that's just the bare minimum, and i wish i could do way more (but i don't know what i could do)

I know this is completely illogical, but the mere fact that i can't simply erase all of her trauma to make her smile hurts. I wish i could hug her forever. I wish i could stop her suffering. I wish i could do so much more, but i'm only human. I really, really love her, and her pain also hurts me. I don't know what i should do to stop this feeling

Also, i should mention that she never, in any way, shape or form tried to blame me for ""not doing enough"", if anything i can see that my presence does indeed help her. This entire problem comes completely from me.  
Sorry if my english is sucks, not my first language"
73,2,"About two months ago, I went on a trip with a group I'm in. There was a lot of drinking and smoking and that kind of thing, and I had a little too much to drink. I had a guy friend who... well, first off, it was really clear he was interested in being more than friends. And he was also kind of chiding me for drinking at all because I'm a lightweight. 

  
Something happened when I got drunk. I'll be ok, and it wasn't as bad as it could've been, but it did affect me. The guy friend was there and I don't want to use the language of ""he let it happen"", but he was aware of how *extra* affected I was that night, how vulnerable I was, that I was with a man who obviously wanted something, and he left. And the vibe of this guy friend after was almost... well, it felt like maybe he thought I deserved what happened afterwards because I was drinking and the guy who did it wasn't him. He didn't explicitly say anything, but he was very cold to me, kinda mean after this trip. That was the gist of our interactions after. Like *I* had done something wrong.

  
I was never attracted to this person. I never thought of them this way. But suddenly, I cared what he thought and wanted his approval? I even - ffs - asked him out because I thought I liked him and mistook this strange trauma response as romantic interest!

  
Meanwhile, I just got asked to be exclusive by a really sweet man I'm truly truly into. I'm very happy and super smitten. I just feel this weird... discomfort every time I think of guy friend. 

  
Anyone ever had something like this? How do I get the general *eeeeek* feeling to go away?"
74,3,"I work at a highly stressful job. I have been diagnosed with ptsd but decades of different abusive situations gave me symptoms that align more with cptsd (i won't list them to avoid triggering people).



I deal with feelings of disappointing people and shame overall. Also hyperarousal. The fun part is im hitting menopause and I keep tearing up so my feelings are not under control in stressful situations at work. It can trigger these feelings. 



To be frank I have SH in the past and im starting to do it again. And im drinking more after work. 



I love my job. And I would love to go into more explanation but I need to be vague. Im blessed that my job also knows what I have and works with me. 



How do you control your emotions and stay steady in a stressful job? Bonus points for doing this while menopausal. "
75,2,So I was diagnosed with ptsd from a lot of bad childhood stuff and my new therapist has discussed complexed ptsd with me but can you get more kinds? I grew up in a household that kept this stuff absolutely quiet and didn't talk about it at all. The idea that I had this diagnosis was hardly ever mentioned or considered. It's hard to understand it all and not gaslight yourself because of it but I uh had to watch someone pass away slowly in a horrible way and I can't get over it and I'm scared it's gonna ruin me the way my childhood has haunted me for most of my life. It's hard enough to work through it let alone what I saw. I guess it's nothing new but it's kind of upsetting if that makes any sense. I really don't know what I'm trying to say. I'm just scared and can't sleep and everything is getting worse. I welcome any help and advice to get out of this nightmare.
76,2,"I wasn't sure where to post this. I dont wanna be specific about this but I've had alot of really strange feelings since I was very little, like, sexual truama responses. And they stick with me to this day. I do have alot of truama that I am aware of and that also effected me pretty badly, but these icky feelings predate all of that. My mother has suggested before that there may have been something that happened when I was little that I am blocking. I don't know. If there is something I don't have a clue. I'm sorry if any of this came off as disrespectful or like I'm just trying to find something to be truamatized about, it's just a bit unsettling and the older I get the more I wonder about it. I don't remember much of my childhood due to truama but most things if I am reminded enough I can recall it at least slightly. But if something happened with no witnesses to remind me of it now, it very well could be blocked out forever. I don't know."
77,1,"I had horrible self esteem starting from early childhood. Now I'm an adult and no one around me cares. I grew up with an abusive family, went to college, got paired with a roommate who had unmedicated Borderline Personality Disorder who then proceeded to threaten to kill herself constantly. Meanwhile, my abusive father was calling me telling me it was my fault he wasn't going to therapy for his anger problems. I started developing chronic pain my freshman year, and to this day it still hasn't been diagnosed.

I was a child. I was 19 when near the end of my freshman year, I started becoming suicidal and wishing cars would hit me while I walked across the street. I did what I thought was the correct thing: I reached out to emergency student counseling and they brought me to the hospital.

I was then severely abused in the hospital and feared for my life every single day because the staff did not protect me from an ex-prisoner patient who was twice my size threatening to beat me up. They did not protect me from another patient 3x my age making sexual comments and hovering over me like a predator. At one point we were put on lockdown and a violent patient trashed the entire main space— throwing tables, punching holes, shattering everything.

I walked in the hospital already with CPTSD. I walked out of the hospital with PTSD because of how traumatizing it was. I wasn't better. 

I was hospitalized several times more over the next few years, and nearly almost died after downing a third of a bottle of Tylenol. The ER doctors and nurses saved my life.

Oh, and when I, someone who used to be a atraight A student, barely managed to graduate college because I was so unwell? A fucking pandemic happened and I ended up stuck in the same abusive home of mine for the next two years. My grandmother died at this time while my parents were going through a nasty divorce. 

Now I'm 28, will be 29 this year, and no one cares. Im working a job i hate. I don't feel good anymore. My psychiatrist is cycling me through medications like I'm a guinea pig. I did TMS for 6 months. Didn't work. Did Ketamine treatments for 6 months. Didn't work. Tried to do outpatient/partial inpatent therapy at a hospital and I was so triggered by simply BEING in a hospital that I got catatonic dissociation.

Hospitals don't work. I'm too broken to be fixed. I'm  too broken to date anyone. I'm  so tired from the workweek every week that I struggle to get up on the weekends and do basic chores, because all I can think  about is how my whole life has led up to this job that I hate, this job that I'm working because I'm not putting together the materials I need to get an acting agent. 

As far as I'm concerned, my life is over. As soon as my cat dies, I'm going with her. I don't see the joy in life anymore. No one knows what to do. I'm rotting away in an apartment. I dissociate around people or have to leave early from friend group meetings because I feel unwell z or a chronic migraine or my chronic pain pops up.

Being alive hurts. I'm too traumatized to be fixed, and even if there was a proper treatment out there, I can't get it because I'd have to stop working and I'd lose my apartment. And I'd be forced to choose between being homeless or going back to my very abusive home.

78,2,"Hi, ugh I just need someone to talk to who will understand. 
9 months ago tomorrow, my beautiful 19 year old nephew took his own life. 
10 days later myself and my partner and 2 daughters flew to Gran Canaria for 2 weeks (holiday had been booked for a year). As you can imagine, those two weeks I was away were so difficult. There was no way I couldn’t go, my girls needed that holiday so reluctantly we went and I put a brave face on and cried when I was alone. 
I was always adamant that I was going to see my nephew at the funeral home, say my last goodbyes or see you soon as I like to say, I believe one day we will be together again, 
We were due to land early hours of the Sunday morning. Due to him decomposing quick, the funeral home kindly opened for me on the Sunday so I could see him. 
The whole flight home was a nightmare, I was anxious, grief stricken, depressed, sad etc. we landed early hours at like 4am which was awful, got home at 5:30am, I slept for 4 hrs then woke up and immediately drove to the funeral home to meet my sister to go in and see him. I have never seen someone so dead before. When I saw him after he took his life, and I mean he had only been dead for an hr he looked like him, like he was sleeping. I spent 2 hrs led on the landing with him talking to him, giving him cuddles and kisses so he wasn’t alone. (He was like a son to me ok, we were very close). It took 2 hrs for the coroner to come and get him. So when I went into the funeral home and saw him what I saw will forever haunt me. On par, those two days were the worst days of my life.
So, this year we are going away again to Gran Canaria (the reason we go to Gran Canaria is because my partners dad owns an apartment there so we get a free holiday) and the flight times home is the same flight time as last year and guys, guuuys, the PTSD and anxiety I have over those flight times is next level horrible. I want to claw my brain out. I am now having flash backs of seeing my nephew in the funeral home, I am feeling those feels I felt when I was flying home. This is honestly awful, I couldn’t book the flight. I had to put my phone down and walk away and will have to try again tomorrow to book them. I can’t change who I fly with because I physically can’t afford paying an extra £1000 to fly lunch time. I have to fly at that haunting time of day. What should I do? How do I control this anxiety and dread? I’m an absolute mess of emotions and I’m worried I book the flight and spend the next 3 months dreading the flight home, spend 2 weeks on holiday dreading the flight home. "
79,2,"While I was asleep I had a flashback of when I was raped that resulted in me wetting myself. The dream felt so real, and now I’m to scared to go to sleep."
80,2,"I still feel quite numb to it and tend to block the image out of my mind. I didn't talk to anyone about finding the body for the next 4 months now I'm trying to start therapy. Every day feels weird. Talked to a therapist who believes I was experiencing ptsd. I think that's likely too, however I tell myself I'm being dramatic. "
81,1,"Hey everyone,  
I was recently diagnosed with PTSD by my psychiatrist, and honestly, I’m still trying to wrap my head around it. When I first sought help, I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, which led me to start medication and CBT. That already changed a lot for me, but things got even heavier recently.

I won't sugarcoat it—I used to be a terrible person. I was manic, unaware, and toxic. I stole from friends, cheated on my long-term girlfriend, hurt people who genuinely cared for me, and pushed everyone away. At the time, I didn’t see it, but therapy opened my eyes to everything I did. And now, the realization hits me like a truck.

Anything that reminds me of those times—an old photo, a place, even certain smells—can completely transport me back. Back to the worst version of myself. Back to moments where I hurt others, where people left me, where I harmed myself just to get attention. It’s like reliving those moments on loop, and it makes me physically sick with guilt and shame.

That’s why my psychiatrist says it’s PTSD. But it’s hard for me to accept that. Can PTSD really come from *your own* actions, especially if they were done during a time of untreated mental illness? I always thought PTSD came from trauma others caused *to you*. I feel like I don’t deserve that label—that it should be reserved for people who’ve suffered, not people like me who did the hurting.

But at the same time, I can’t deny how real the flashbacks and emotional spirals are.

Is this what PTSD really feels like? Has anyone else experienced this kind of trauma response from regret, guilt, or facing the consequences of your own behavior?

Any insight or shared experiences would really help. I’m committed to healing and being a better person, but it’s hard to know where I fit in all of this.

Thanks for reading."
82,2,"25F, posted in international aviation segment, I am independent, parents living 1300 miles apart I am the sole child... PTSD as was ignored as kid, even though showered with all the luxuries through parents, grateful for whatever little or big I had or have. Spiritual. Was the one left out in a fake group of friends probably didn't deserve but experienced two of my best friends sleeping with the early age bf, move on from suicidal phase cuz was never easy, relationships were always hard. Healed myself moved out of hometown to see the fast life. Ended up meeting the walking nightmare who kept me in a bubble for whole 9 almost months - this
Potential fiancè Mr. Singh - got me to meet his family (just for ref abandoned by his mother for years who escaped with his existing step father - broken family)  his family tried puppeting me to how I should quit my job and settle down with their son, while failed at doing so..they started mocking at my family for no caste (idk what my religion is except for being a Hindu cuz my dad was an orphan so I never bothered asking him about his history, but he never failed at providing) they mocked at our occupation as we are not Khandani/Brahmin by blood and brainwashing their son about how my father could probably be a brothel child and I lured their son Mr. Singh to be wid me for generational weath they possess.. 
Mr Singh after I almost gave up showed some signs of fake sympathy, but he then asked me to not to simply talk to his parents again - this lead to his mother sending me death threats over voice notes one great day..and boasting about how they had been ruling over Mathura as khandani Rajputs and their folks keeps celebrating over bails from prison..praising it hard enough and abusing my family and me for nothing..telling me how she's gonna murder me and my family as she got every detail and addresses. I don't want to file a complaint as I know this is her act of cowardice, like I stay by myself, I am completely engulfed in job can't think about losing it cuz that's the only hard earned thing I achieved in my life yet. (I miss my hobbies so bad 💔 )
Mr Singh..had always kept me in a bubble never even letting me doubt himself, in the meanwhile this all was feeling too heavy on my heart but he managed to even cheat me as I caught him today, now it's 9 months and I caught him chatting and being in a dual relationship with not ONE but 2 of his EXes and as I was lucky enough.. I could find him micro-cheating on me, I won't say he's a porn addict but he is more of like a sick person who lusts over all these nude ladies on social media, also I caught him with history which said "" Call girls in -xyz- locations""- I caught him today when it's almost 9 months his parents were no less, even he gave up on me at some point, I kept begging cuz I was in a bubble that he loved me and cared for me just cuz he helps me in household chores so he's a can make a good husband. And he continued this 9 freaking months..with everyday lusting over and being in dual damn relationships...it all ended as I checked his phone today! And Mr Singh still begs and cries everyday now swearing he gonna fix things. 
What I gave him from Day 1, was my essential time, efforts, cooked cleaned for him and also was paying every bills for transport, food, lodging, parties, travel, his gadi ka petrol etc etc.. I mean what not, my family knows well what his family did still my Dad accepted him cuz I said my Dad that Mr Singh is loyal to me, we divide our tasks, maybe some days I do more but he do even more never gets tired of me. He slept wid me Ate wid me the whole time, Made me eat with his hands, he learnt to cook for me from YTchannels just for me to realize one day he had been betraying me all the time. Now all he has to do is apologize and fake hopes that he won't repeat he will change, begs cries for me in my feet every single day now. No signs of guilt, nothing. 
What to do?! 💔💔💔💔💔

83,2,"Hello,

I am writing here out of desperation because I know anyone who has ptsd can understand me. I am also a highly sensitive person with ADHD and perhaps has a bit of autism too. I am very sensitive to noise, and we all know that exposure to noise can create anxiety. My trauma is due to a lot of stress and anxiety, a bad experience that lasted long and created a big impact on me. Every time I hear a car passing fast outside the house creates a lot of anxiety, chest pain, my blood pressure increases and I get very irritable and all I want to do is cry. I did not want to come to this house where I am, I told my husband and he knows I can't tolerate many cars passing by, it triggers the flight of fight which I am on high alert constant since I moved here almost 2 weeks ago. I was not well mentally and emotionally when I signed the contract and only did it because my husband said I could leave if I couldn't be here. The thing is now he is saying that I should contact the estate agent and landords and explain what is happening, I don't feel any support from him and I don't have money to leave and put myself in a safe place. I told him I needed a place where I could be alone and without stimulants so I could start regulating my nervous system again and get better.

All I need is a place in England or Wales where I can have peace, near the sea, in nature and in a house, studio, cabin or whatever that don't have cars passing by fast.

If you have any advice or know a place where I could go, I can't think clearly right now.

Thank you

Edit: I spoke with a lady that did a biofeedback scan on me last week who explained a bit more what I am going through. I will create another post to share the information I have so maybe it helps others. Thank you everyone who read or commented, it helps everyone feel supported and loved."
84,2,"I'm not sure who else to ask, but I’ll just get into it. I want to put a TW for those sensitive to SA, I’ve left out some details but certain things may still be distressing for those who don’t do well with this sort of info.


I was SA'd by my ex around a year and a half ago, but the circumstances surrounding it would make prosecuting him very difficult/lengthy. However, I can't help but feel awful for not reporting it for many reasons. I feel like I could stop him from doing this to someone else, I feel like it's my fault if it happens to another girl, and I feel like l've done myself a massive injustice. To give context into why I feel this way, I'll give a short (ish) story on what happened over the past 4 years this whole thing even started:

When I was in highschool I met a boy, who I'll call “K"". I started talking to him in school in my final year because my best friend at the time had a crush on him and wanted me to ask him to join our friend group, as she was too shy to do it herself. Unfortunately, this boy ended up taking and interest in me instead, which I did not really reciprocate. One day when I decided to invite him over to my house to play video games (which we had all hung out in a group together before, so I felt comfortable doing this at the time), he told me he had a crush on me, to which I told him I don't want any physical contact when he comes over later and that i absolutely want no sexual contact, which he agreed to. By the time he came over to my house and we started playing games, he ended up SAing me. I didn't say no while it was happening (but said before in the texts I didn't want that), so I stayed silent and let it happen. After this, he decided to tell my friends I had consensual relations with him, and they unfortunately ended up believing him over me when I tried to explain what happened. These were the popular girls in a very small town, so overnight my life was turned upside down and I was hated by everyone as well as harassed both in school and at my workplace.
Because of this, I had no friends and decided to date K like he originally wanted me to (before I kept telling him no), and he basically told me we are “already dating anyways because we already had relations"". This relationship ended up lasting the rest of the year until I got out of highschool, which I broke up with him after prom because I didn't like how he got me to date him and felt deeply uncomfortable even after forming a weird bond with him throughout our relationship (likely because he was the only person I could talk to since everyone else hated me). I left for college out of my hometown shortly after this, expecting my life to get better.

Two years passed and it never really got better. I couldn't make friends, couldn't trust people, and ended up getting into another relationship which also ended up being sexually abusive. I found myself missing K from highschool, as I liked the fact that I visited him every day after school and had someone to talk to. Randomly, he ended up reaching out to me on social media, and apologized to me/told me how he's changed over the past two years and how much he regrets treating me. I believed this, and because I missed how we used to talk, I agreed to be his friend. Slowly our relationship evolved into flirting, and I was fine with this at the time, as I began to trust him again. Eventually, he invited me to see a movie with him, and by the time l got to his house to pick him up, a snowstorm hit and we got snowed in. He suggested we just rent it and watch it in his room, and I agreed. We ended up cuddling, and this I was also fine with, until he ended up trying to take it to the next level. He tried to kiss me which I told him no, but he ended up ignoring me and doing it anyways. Things started to escalate, and he ended up forcing my legs open (which I was closing with all my strength) and I was telling him clearly ""no"" and to ""stop"" this time, since I told myself that was what I did wrong last time. This still didn't stop him, he was stronger than me, and ended up doing what he wanted, and I gave up and just cried instead. I left once the snow calmed down in silence.

Later on he texted me and asked me why I was ignoring him, which ended in a fight where he told me he doesn't remember me saying no to anything sexual ""other than to kissing"" and denied anything even happened. I blocked him.

This was a year and 6 months ago now.

Since then, I feel like he might be doing this to another girl. I feel like if he is, I could've stopped it by telling the police what happened when it happened. But at the same time, I can't help but think it's too late to report now, it'll result in nothing happening, the police won't believe me/wont take it serious, and that I'll be to blame because I had flirted with him beforehand. I also feel at times that I've done myself a huge injustice, that l've betrayed who I always say I am-someone who doesn't let anyone walk over them, someone who is strong and does what is right, and someone who speaks up when there's injustice, especially towards myself. I often find myself lying awake thinking about how frustrated I am with how much I want to go after him legally, but how scared I am to not be believed, to have my phone taken away, and have my messages read/judged by people who will ask me why I flirted with him if I didn't want to be with him that way. If I'm honest, I don't know what to do, I feel torn between giving into my anxiety about it and believing what everyone says about the justice system ignoring these cases/straight up not believing me, versus saving other women and doing myself justice. I feel haunted by these thoughts pretty often, and I feel its impact on my life. I feel empty most days, can't get up to shower, can't take care of myself, and just lay down all day. I feel like I'm not who I say I am, and that I lie to myself when I try to tell people that I don't let people disrespect me.

I don't know what's wrong with me and what I should even do about any of this, I know my fear comes from PTSD, but at the same time I’ve heard so much from others about how horrible the system is that it also scares me. I feel like I’m a coward who is letting him get away with everything, I feel like it’s my fault, I feel like I have become a part of the problem. I’ve even started to dream about being assaulted almost every night, this really is haunting me and i genuinely don’t know what to do/where to start.  

Has anyone gone through something similar? If so, what have you done/are you doing to ease the thoughts and worries?"
85,2,"**CW: War and the bs that comes with it \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\***

okay, never said that before, especially not on the internet. but i want to seek help and advice so i guess i kinda gotta explain myself.

im israeli, (19, non-binary) something life threatening happened to me not too long ago as a result of the israel-palestine conflict and war, and as a result of that - ptsd diagnosis. i won't get into any more detail on what i've stated up till right now. anyways, my stupid ass government decided ""aight let's attack iran"" which obviously caused them to respond and send missiles back. yesterday was an absolute shit show.

scary sounds and warnings, missiles everywhere, i even saw the commotion in the sky with my very own eyes. i couldn't sleep because i had this sense of impending doom and i was going through a whole panic attack, telling myself ""this is it. i've been hurt one time and this time im actually going to die."" i'd take the sleeping pills i got, but this time around? when i could miss an alert and die? no thank you. i feel like i need to escape this place. i told my dad - ""as long as i'm alive, i can't live here."" since my life was already at risk simply because of that.

I feel so much anger towards our government. the big guys don't care, and civilians end up as the casualties. What's worse? They are aware of the insane amount of PTSD and other mental health problems a major part of our people developed thanks to this - and they don't give a shit. why would they?

Please, have a bit of compassion and tell me how the fuck to deal with this becaue i don't think it's gonna end soon. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to cope with PTSD in the first place, i have a psycologist and a psychiatrist - i get help, but i wasn't told.

86,2,I feel like a complete burden to everyone around me. I feel like i don't fit in anywhere. I let anxiety completely ruin my life and i can't do anything about it because i can't afford health insurance but i don't qualify for any government insurance so therapy is out of question. Everything is just really hard and heavy and I need some motivation to keep going. 
87,3,"I want to share a very hard experience I went through When I began talking about my trauma with a mental health specialist my condition worsened a lot I felt a sharp trembling in my left leg and a slight paralysis in my right hand. My mind felt extremely confused, like the whole world was standing still at that moment.

It was terrifying and overwhelming, but I want to be honest about how real and intense these reactions can be. Has anyone else experienced something similar? How did you cope?

The event happened three years ago, but I only started noticing the effects of the trauma in the last two or three months. Whenever I'm under pressure or overwhelmed by strong emotions, I feel these symptoms. There are things I can't control. The event is still inside me, and I can't forget it or live with it peacefully."
88,2,"I feel like I can already answer this with yes because it should be normal. But I feel humiliated by it I guess, I know the “ expectation” is that I should’ve moved beyond all of this but my nervous system is still stuck in it, this is like over at 10 years to this point the closest 5 years ago. But I’m suffering in these moments still. "
89,1,"I'm in a really weird, awful point in my life right now. Financially, I'm somewhat more secure than I was for the past couple of months (found a new job at Amazon– not excited about it at all but it's only temporary bc I'm moving to a city with better job prospects in a few months) but despite that being the main thing I was super worried about over the past couple of weeks, I don't feel as relieved as I thought i would be. I guess I'm just really used to shit going wrong? 

The second most thing I'm upset about is just.. everything about my social life. I feel like the odd one out in my friend group because every single one of them is either currently in a relationship or has been in one before, and here I am with neither (at the embarrassing age of 22). A friend I went on a date with a little over a year ago (it didn't amount to anything– we pretty much mutually agreed we weren't compatible) is now dating another friend of mine and I just feel awkward because... I don't even really know why. But it's made me feel even more like some alien and I've been withdrawing from my friends more. 

Thanks to therapy, I'm now aware of a litany of problems I have with trust/forming attachments in general, but knowing what the problem is doesn't really do much to solve it, especially when I haven't had regular therapy sessions since March (my old therapist I got along really well with didn't mesh well with my old job's schedule, so I had to find someone else. And then there was the financial aspect of me barely being able to afford sessions until now). 

I know no one's going to read or even care about this because I pretty much don't exist, but I just felt like venting. I've felt like a disgusting weird alien that doesn't fit in with normal people for a really long time, and I'm honestly thinking this is just how my life is going to be. Financial stress and being the satellite friend of every group I'm in. What even is the point anymore"
90,2,"Anyone relate to this? It just feels like they get close with an intimate moment and then push me away with anger, criticism, irritation and annoyance. He doesn’t want to be touched, he leaves when triggered— he hides until he feels safe.  When I confront him on it he says it’s his issue and not to take it personally. But I do— bc he’s criticizing my behaviour a lot of the time and if only I didn’t do XYZ. And if only I didn’t trigger him, he would not feel anger— which is manipulation and I know it. Today he was upset I didn’t directly acknowledge him when he arrived as I was in the middle of problem solving a task. He said he was pissed about it. He’s already shared we are to acknowledge him when he comes home or we wake up and say good morning. If we don’t he says we are ignoring him. He asked me to apologize for ignoring him, I said sure it’s also the impact of what you say that hurts. He didn’t want to apologize and feels entitled to his anger as “you made me feel”— I said it’s still the impact. He reluctantly apologized for the impact and then follows it with “I have no more energy for you today, just our son, whatever he needs, but not for you”. So it’s followed by stonewalling. Am I crazy to stay? 

There’s so many things I could write a 200 page novel— the insults for decades when he’s triggered — and bc I have ADHD memory issues and anxiety… I forget and I move on. But I realize I ask to help him bc I’m people pleasing and I don’t want him to yell. The day before he spilt our kids milk, our kid said he was making him feel scared, he started to hide behind the couch — his response was I was frustrated about the milk - and maybe next time help him clean up the milk - he says this to our kid … I also feel sad I’m in this situation, I fear him aging and the dementia and ongoing depression waves as the years go on— and I am isolated as well bc both my parents are gone and I’m an only child. It feel very lonely here and I try to reach out to others, I let his family know, I have some solo hobbies, I’m just very afraid on a lot of levels of him taking our son or making up some story — bc I could see That if I’m the bad guy to him.  Bc he’s Said if you hurt me I would Hurt you more. What do I do? Thanks for listening and understanding it’s difficult to make a choice.  "
91,2,"So I have religious ptsd, and as you can imagine watching America embrace Christian Nationalism isn't helping at all. 

I'm trying to make plans to move to another state at least, because I'm in the Bible belt. But should I just be getting out of dodge? And if so, how? I was homeschooled, so I don't know if my transcript would actually mean anything internationally. Not to mention I'm in my mid 20s with no college education. Plus I have ptsd, which definitely disables me, lol. 

Idk. Thought I might as well write this out because it's on my mind. In theory I want to stay and fight, but I keep experiencing ptsd episodes around protests, and frankly don't have any support group. If I was arrested, I'd be on my own, I guess. "
92,2,"tw for sa!!

im sorry if this comes off as uneducated but i wanted to know how common it is for people to get actual pain when their ptsd is triggered?

i went through a violent sa when i was 14 that caused major pain in my legs; now, whenever something slightly triggers me, i get an awful painful ache down them that literally paralyses me until i can calm down. i was wondering if there was any possible connection between the trauma and the pain, like my body remembering what happened, or if its just general anxiety causing it?"
93,1,"I am not officaly diagnosed with PTSD yet, but all the symptoms do check up.
But if I'm actually gonna try to change my official diagnosis from schizophrenia to PTSD this would be a looot of work.
Why you might ask? Cuz I live in the 2nd world country.

Im a male in my early 20s.
So the thing is that I was abused by the initiative of my own family (although I'm an orphan since the age of 5, so my legal parent used to be a mom of my sister which i share a father with).

And the thing is that I don't even see a point to try right now to do anything. My head is a mess after months of being drugged with antipsychotics.

It feels hopeless trying to rebuild everything that my life used to be before the abuse.

Aaand by abuse I mean something that some legal practice would consider as torture.
You could say that I was tortured for almost a year being deprived of just a basic right to sleep.

Before the kidnapping I was as far from being labeled as mentally ill as possible.

But after almost a year of abuse I started experiencing psychotic symptoms.
Right now I have some partial amnesia regarding these days.
So after several days of so-called psychosis (and of being tied to bed for several nights and left alone) my relative had taken me out of that place and drove me off to psychiatric facility.

And by living in a country with poor protection of human righrs of course they just labeled me as schizophrenic (although my foster mother has told me that the first diagnosis they told her was ""dementia"").

So yeah, then there was more abuse, but in a less sadistic way.

Long story short after stopping taking the meds and being off them for almost half a year I started experiencing strong symptoms of PTSD.

Although it seems like I will move out of this sick, sick household very soon (thanks to some acquaintances of mine) !!! But I really do experience strong psychological flashbacks of being in the place where I was illegally deprived of freedom. And all the other symptoms of PTSD I experience too in one way or another."
94,2,"i went through a traumatic situation as a young teenager and it left me with a lot of guilt. part of the problem i’ve had since becoming an adult is avoiding certain behaviours/activities/milestones particularly ones that have the potential to cause harm to others. 

the biggest problem i have is driving. i just can’t get into learning because i’m constantly worried i’ll do the wrong thing and harm someone. i know this comes directly from the traumatic incident and i’ve had a few other manifestations of this - avoiding picking up pets in case i do something wrong and hurt them, avoiding or at least worrying that food i make for others will cause illness or harm. but nothing has stuck as persistently and negatively as the driving fear. 

the driving thing really gets me down sometimes. i want to get through it because i know how much independence i’ll gain once i’ve got it sorted. i’m just feeling worse because of something a close friend said. i’ve only shared this problem with 2 close friends (A and B). i told A about this literally yesterday and they were so supportive and understanding. they also have diagnosed PTSD although for very different reasons but they were totally understanding and had been through similar fears. friend B was the first person i told about this because i really trusted them about it but they just joked recently about how i won’t actually get my license. i know it’s a joke and not serious but it just makes me feel like i can’t do basic milestones that other people can do easily. it’s so frustrating and makes me wish i hadn’t gone through what i did because then i’d just live without having to doubt everything. and it makes me wonder if my friends think it’s weird that i haven’t learnt yet. i just feel weird because i trusted friend B and at the time i kept saying how embarrassed i was to share what i’d been going through. they know what the original trauma event was and we’ve been friends since before it happened. so even though they were joking i just feel embarrassed that the trauma is making me avoid things like driving and how maybe to friends or other people it makes me look silly? or immature?

it feels like basic milestones take so much more effort and consideration when i do them. i know driving fears are common regardless of trauma but it’s just so intense. it makes me feel embarrassed sometimes that i can’t just get on with life and how it affects me after almost a decade. 

does anyone else have these issues or anything similar? i used to go to therapy but i found regularly discussing the trauma again would trigger really intense symptoms which i couldn’t handle. i’ve considered going back though and trying different types of therapy i’m just afraid it’ll flare up badly like before but then i really want to work through some of these issues as i think theyre holding me back"
95,0,"Hello, I’m (28F) kind of confused on the topic of sex abuse/assault. I apologize, as this may be a stupid question. If a child (11) spent multiple years talking to several adult men online (explicit texting and romantic relations) and the men knew that they were speaking to a child (that was disclosed) but proceeded to send them explicit and/or extremely violent sexual texts, videos, pictures and threats, is that sexual abuse? In this scenario, the minor didn’t send pictures or videos of themselves (the men could only see the profile picture of them) and was never physically touched by any of these men, but felt extreme distress and fear surrounding these conversations, yet pursued them and continued them. Is that abuse or assault? If so, do you think that would cause lasting issues for the minor? This isn’t being asked for any legal reasons, I am just looking for direction and advice on what to do and how to view it. If yes, any advice on how to help the victim accept that what happened is wrong and isn’t their fault?

Again, I’m really sorry if this is a stupid question. I just want to learn and make sure I understand correctly. Thank you for your time!

Also, this isn’t being asked with the purpose of labeling them as anything. I’m just trying to help myself understand.

I just want to understand."
96,2,"Update. 

After taking much of the advice and support here to heart, I ended up going. Even bumped into friends and co-workers. Tried going towards the front but it was too much, so I hung back. It was a very good day. Thank you everyone.

OG Post:

Don't want this to be political. We all know protests happen on all sides.

I was diagnosed with PTSD two and a half years ago as the result of multiple, yet completely separate, near death experiences involving gun violence. 

I've tried trauma therapy but so far EMDR made things worse and I'm about to try brain spotting 

I'd like to participate in the protest tomorrow. This is an important moment in history and it's time for everyone to take a stand.

But I'm terrified that I will have a episode with all of the crowds, police, national guard, and my fellow protestors, all of whom will be all armed (gotta love Texas)...my girlfriend is worried about me and wants me to sit this one out....after all, she has to deal with it when I have an episide....but I'm also concerned that not going will also trigger me because it will be all I'll be able to focus on.

I hate this."
97,2,"Hi Guys,

I was diagnosed with PTSD after my Father died of cancer in 2018 when I was 22. It's a long story but basically there was a lot more trauma to his passing than the cancer itself (which was clearly horrible in it's own right) as he mentally imploded before his passing and became very abusive and I copped the brunt of that behaviour. 

In the time since I've slowly but surely rebuilt my life and actually have a lot of really positive stuff to be grateful for now including being married and planning to start a family with my wife. I'm also very functional and work quite a stressful job managing a small business whilst getting a few exercise sessions in a week and seeing friends etc. so on the surface I'm really productive.

My issue is the way my body and mind has felt ever since I went through my traumatic period. It's just never felt the same and I feel like I lost the ability to relax somewhere along the way. I constantly feel on ""high alert"" and like I don't fully enjoy good things while they are happening. I look forward to the weekends but when they come and I don't have work distractions I seem to invent relatively insignificant things to worry about, it's like I just can't be relaxed and content and I'm always scanning for the next thing that could go wrong. This is reflected in both my poor posture (which I'm trying to fix with physio exercises etc.) and my attention span which I feel like has greatly reduced since all the bad stuff happened. 

I logically know that everything is ok and wish I could feel more settled but it's become a very deeply ingrained and subconscious habit. 

I've just finished reading ""the body keeps the score"" and really related to it but also found it a bit light on for practical solutions other than yoga (which I now do thanks to YouTube several times a week). Both meditation and yoga does help a lot but I find the tense feelings very quickly scale back up again when I go back into my regular life tasks. 

Has anybody had similar experiences and how did you go about convincing your body and mind that it's safe again? "
98,2,"For context I went through something a few years ago that messed me up. At the time I was dealing with it but having debilitating and persistent nightmares. I deal with bipolar and no matter what I tried I couldn’t shake it. It got so bad I had to leave the country for 2 months. While it still effected me here and there, I’ve been actively working through therapy to try and help ease myself. Then recently it all changed. 

I’ve been having triggers that have led to random attacks throughout the day. Yesterday I had 3 anxiety attacks. So I took a boat load of meds. Idk what happened but it all cause light sensitivity. So suddenly any light would burn my eyes. And as someone afraid of the dark, it’s one of the worst experiences. Eventually it faded. I took a Valium and went to sleep. I woke up and asked my roommate for a charger and immediately after I got this charger this fear just came out of no where, suddenly I couldn’t breath, I kept having events recirculate over and over again to which made it worse. Lasted 2 hrs. The only changes that have been made have been moving from IV ketamine to spravato (but I started that treatment over a month ago) and I recently got diagnosed with H pylori so for the past week I’ve been taking antibiotics. Since Friday (1st day of the antibiotics) I began to get paranoid. I felt like there was a shadow over me which would cause me to anxious but not panicky. But these past couple days I can’t stop the panic. Idk what to do.  I’m taking the meds, I’ve been in my therapy to help me cope, I’m literally doing everything by the book. And yet I’m still getting panicked. 

I have a vacation for a wedding next week and I’m so terrified of staying in this household with people. I don’t like anyone seeing me like this. I don’t want anyone to see me depressed or manic. And the rules with these roommates to say that I need to sleep in the dark and wear a shock watch (I have a rigid time I have to wake up so I have really loud alarms on cuz I can’t hear it when I sleep) is ridiculous. The dark? I can’t sleep in the dark, it freaks me out. 

Anyway, what can I do. You mean to tell me when I wake up I’m scared, paranoid and panicking. And I mean minutes after I wake up and grab a damn charger & now I’m freaking out for almost 2 hours? How does that even happen? I’m at a loss and it’s starting to make me depressed and overall honest to god I’m so tired of this. It’s taking a physical and mental toll on me. I can’t keep dealing with this. "
99,2,"My husband and I traveled for 9 months straight. I was sick off and on through most of the trip, but most of it was manageable. I deal with some chronic health conditions so it wasn’t entirely unexpected. 

In March, shortly after getting to Japan, I became completely bed bound and incapacitated for a month by some sort of respiratory illness. Bronchitis, pink eye, and strep throat rolled into one basically. It was hell and getting medical care was hell-er. I recovered. Shaken and weak but ready to move on with our trip. 

About a week and a half later I was hit with a brutal stomach bug that ended up with the clinic sending me to the hospital in an ambulance because they thought it was appendicitis. I also have severe emetophobia, for what it’s worth. I quite literally felt trapped in a hotel room, a foreign country, and language I couldn’t understand with no comfortable means of getting home. The after effects from the virus lasted almost a month. 

Ever since then every little thing about my body that seems out of whack sends me into a full blown spiral. Doctors visit? Panic attack. Thinking about any part of our trip? Panic attack. My psych and long term therapist both agree it’s a form of PTSD and I’m livid about it. It’s so stupid. People have been through literal hell and back and I’m losing my mind over being sick? 

No real advice needed. I’m just 24 hours post brutal panic attack and feeling stuck in tearful depersonalization. I’m tired. "
100,1,"i would really like a book that talks about how to physically explore my sexuality on my own after years suffering from the after effects of sexual trauma. i dont want a book about only emotional exercises or therapy as i have worked on that a ton. 

i just need to learn how to experience my body again, ive been in physical and occupational therapy to connect with the feelings in my body. but this hasnt done anything for being able to easily find pleasure in my body

ive read countless articles that have all said the same thing, breathing or lighting candles or setting up a mood but none of that works for me. believe me ive tried time ans time again. trying to be more mindful and present in those moments- but that doesnt make a difference for me

i need a workbook or guidebook with meditations or questions i can ask myself and explore with myself in a sexy way! something along the lines of “healing from trauma related dissociation” but for sex & pleasure would be ideal

i dont want it to be somber, or focus on a whole ton of stories about other’s abuse. i want it to be about pleasure and healing 

bonus if it is trans & queer friendly but thats not a dealbreaker for me. though in fact a book  about how to explore yourself as a queer person would also be helpful

thank you for any suggestions, even if theres nothing like this exactly, anything with even a few of these qualities would help. 

google is just absolutely useless and im tired of every listicle giving body keeps the score and trauma and recovery, as if i hadnt read those already. not to mention theyre not exactly guide books"
101,1,"Tw: brief mention of sudden death

It was 5 years ago that my brother was murdered. 5 years ago this time of day he was planting flowers and enjoying sunshine. I take comfort in that. He sent me morning texts with love, like he always did. I miss my best friend. 

We went through hell in life and since he’s been gone I have to be honest when I share that my life feels like it has become about just getting through each day. He was my safe place. I don’t understand why I am here."
102,2,"I made this account today to be separate to my other one for privacy. 

For some back story I have some trauma (sa) and got bullied about it in high school. It was four years ago and I have been finally happy and felt ok recently. 

Earlier this year my bestie explained that one of my former friends (who bullied) said it was high school drama. I had to tell her it’s not to me and now she understands it but I never really explained how bad it was as no one could understand the extent of it back then.

I’m not sure why but I think being ok and stable made my mind and body finally be able to unblock that period of my life. 

I recently started getting PTSD again when I typically don’t if I avoid triggers. I just wanted to know if it’s normal to feel like this after so long. 

It feels like I’m just making myself upset when it’s been years. I’ve reached out to support systems but have struggled so much lately (badly but I’m making SURE I look after myself) and I can’t understand how something comes back after so long.

Is this normal? Is it wrong that I still feel like this and can’t forgive people who hurt me at the time? I feel so guilty for being upset with my old friends who can’t understand the severity of it and it also hurts me. Is it also normal to be hurt by that?

Sorry for venting, I just wanted advice from others who could possibly understand what I’m going through."

106,1,"I believe I may have assisted my dad into k*lling himself. For more context, when I have 5 years old my mom died. I didn't know at the time that she k*lled herself. My dad just told me she smoked too much and that's why she died. The night my dad k*lled himself he was in the living room with me (I was 7 or 8) and I was watching Happy Feet. He was messing with pill bottles and I asked what he was doing. He then when on to tell me my mom didn't die from smoking, she died of an OD. I didn't know what that meant and he explained. He said all this while he was opening pill bottles and dumping them on a plate, eating them slowly. He was a drug addict and had lots in the house. I didn't understand what he was doing, I was just a kid. He handed me a bunch of bottles and told me to start opening them. I think part of me knew what was going on but the other part of me didn't understand fully that this was actually happening. He died that night. His ex came in the next morning and I already knew he was dead. I feel like I caused it. I feel like I could've done something. I'm now 20 years old and the older I get the more I think about it, and the more I think about why he did it. My dad was not a good man. He abused me. He had wh*res at our house with me in the same room as them. He forced me to smoke weed when I was 6 just because I asked if I could go to the play ground. One time he passed out drunk on top of me and I couldn't move him and I felt like I was going to die. But part of me feels like I could've stopped him. I need to know if I'm a horrible person for not stopping him. "

109,0,"Hi I’m no expert on PTSD so I wanted to ask the following: my mom told me that one of our relatives went through a traumatic event many years ago (I would prefer not to go into specifics to protect their privacy) and my mom thinks it’s the reason our relative talks in such a harsh and mean way towards other people even when they make easily fixable mistakes  (and even when they don’t deserve unfair treatment). 

My mom told me our relative’s trauma is the reason why our other family members remain silent or passive when our relative talks in a harsh and mean way to other people. But tbh I don’t think my relative’s trauma is an excuse to be unnecessarily mean to other people and an excuse for them to treat others however tf they want to. It doesn’t sound right. 

Is this issue common? Or is it just my mom giving our relative an excuse? I would greatly appreciate as many perspectives as possible. If you need more context, please let me know.

110,1,"Rapid cycling Bipolar 1, such a fun disease. To start I was manic and voluntarily homeless for reasons I can’t explain. I’m homeless for a month and my mania turned into psychosis, next thing I know I’m arrested. Then when I’m released I get arrested again this time I got beaten so severely the back of my head was bleeding all over the wall in the police station. 

I run off after getting released still psychotic and get arrested after trying to jump out of the car. This time I’m sent to the psych ward, usually the psych ward is a place to help patients become stable and recover but this was hell on earth. They would strap my arms and legs down to the bed in a room with no windows, lights on 24/7, there’s a iPad sized tv that has no remote and plays the same show every hour of every day. You have to get up and out of the room to use the bathroom which is a completely see through glass door with no shower curtain. Multiple times when I got up to simply use the bathroom the guards would jump me, beat me senseless, and tie me down to my bed for more than 2 days. 

They denied me of all calls to my lawyer and parents. They shot me up with sedatives every day and would serve the same meal. I was bed ridden for 2 weeks, if I wanted to use the bathroom I had to endure beatings and have a nurse bring in a bed pan where I’m watched urinating where they can see my junk. The cells were situated like a prison: heavy metal doors with a very small window. One guy that was in there with me would scream and yell for so long I couldn’t sleep most nights and I had to get over it in order to sleep. The other guy stabbed his girlfriend over and over in a attempted murder and he would freak out.  

I learned to just stay in my bed and not drink any fluids. I cried myself to sleep most nights and the show that was on the tv gives me an instant panic attack if I see it on cable. Nobody talks about this point in my life and I feel so isolated and alone. I haven’t been right since, I used to be outgoing and social now I worry about every word I say and I mostly ramble. I envy everyone who’s been able to say to others, “I had a 2 week grippy sock vacation” I learned that if you have problems with your mental health, never show or tell anyone "

It’s just constantly being 100% aware of my surroundings thats stressing me, i’m always worried about the things going on around me, if I can’t sleep at night i just get so paranoid "

The tremors don't seem to be correlated with nightmares or intrusive memories, and if anything it gets worse when I'm home or let my guard down. My doctor and I have been treating this as a neurological issue, but I was wondering if anyone else experiences anything similar, because we haven't been able to identify a physical cause. "

I feel anxious every day. And Just feeling really gross about the whole situation and stuck over analyzing the whole thing. He isn’t a bad person I think he just struggles a lot mentally—

I just started with a new therapist, and it’s been years since I’ve been in therapy. So far, I’ve only talked about little things—stuff that’s happened during the week or practical things—but I really want to go deeper. I just feel scared and embarrassed to bring up the real stuff. I’ve been in an abusive relationship, and it’s so hard to say that out loud. This whole thing makes me feel like I’m going crazy.

I feel stuck—trapped in one way of thinking. I don’t trust people easily, and I keep reaching out to him and seeing him, even though I know it’s not good for me. A big part of me doesn’t want to start over.

Lately, I feel so disconnected from everything. Numb, anxious, like I’m just floating in my own head. I replay moments again and again, trying to make sense of them. I saw him again recently, and now I just feel stupid. I had ended the relationship months ago and was starting to feel okay. But now it feels like I’m being pulled back in.

We were together for five years. And even though there were good moments, there were also so many times I felt scared, powerless, and completely alone. Things would seem fine, then something awful would happen—and afterward, it was like it had never happened. I started questioning my own memory, my own reality.

I think I’ve been avoiding saying this, but I’m starting to realize the relationship was abusive. And now I’m stuck in this painful place where I feel conflicted. I don’t want to ruin his life. He has nothing—no money, no stability, serious mental health issues. But at the same time, what happened hurt me deeply. And I can’t pretend it didn’t.

His family ignores or excuses what he does. When I try to talk about it, I feel gaslit—not just by him, but by them too. It makes me question myself.

Here are some of the things I remember clearly:
	•	One time, I was crying and he slapped me across the face. The more I cried, the angrier he got.
	•	He once pushed me into a towel rack and dented it because I accidentally tossed his pants and they hit his face.
	•	He tried to force me to drink shroom tea. When I refused, he shoved it toward me until it spilled, then slapped me and called me a “stupid bitch.” He said I was the problem and called me a we*.
	•	He stormed into my apartment after drinking, screaming that I abandoned him. He threw my things around, ripped my shirt off, and physically restrained me. My roommate had to kick him out.
	•	The first time he grabbed my neck, I was half-naked. Afterward, I had to do a Zoom meeting with a scratchy voice. When I brought it up, he claimed it was sexual and said I was exaggerating.
	•	He would refuse to drive me to work unless we had sex. If I cried or was late, he’d threaten not to take me.
	•	During sex, if he was frustrated or couldn’t get aroused, he’d pinch me, pull my hair, and call me names. He’d accuse me of cheating or being a “bitch.”
	•	Once, he climbed on top of me and hit me in the head several times because I accidentally hit his eye with his pants.
	•	He drove erratically, pulling my hair and saying we’d both die because I talked about leaving. I had a full-blown panic attack.
	•	He choked me—multiple times. Not for long, but enough to terrify me.
	•	He wouldn’t let me go to the bathroom during sex. Even when I was crying, he wouldn’t let me stop.
	•	His cousin once overheard me crying during a fight and came in. He got even angrier and blamed me for someone seeing me like that.
	•	When his brother was staying in the same room, he made me have sex with him in the bathroom. I felt humiliated but didn’t know how to say no.
	•	He used to “inspect” me to check if I’d been with anyone else, while he himself was cheating.
	•	Once, he bit my face in anger and held me down, poking me in the chest while I cried.
	•	I believe, early in our relationship, he may have done something sexual to me while I was half asleep after getting high. It’s blurry, but it still haunts me.
	•	If I said something hurt or I didn’t want to continue during sex, he’d make fun of me, say I was lying, or keep going.
	•	He called me a sl*, a we*, a cheater—just for wanting to see my friends or family. Meanwhile, he was the one lying and cheating.

I hate admitting this, but sometimes I gave in to sex because I was afraid of what he’d do if I said no. I’d cry during or after and feel like my body didn’t belong to me anymore. Sometimes he wouldn’t let me get dressed or would make me stay in certain positions until he was ready.

One time, neighbors heard me crying and him yelling. He was throwing things, screaming threats through the wall, calling them w****s, saying he’d kill them. Later, he blamed me for everything.

So why do I still feel conflicted?

He has trauma. Mental health issues. A part of me still wants him to be okay. But none of that justifies what he did.

Does this count as abuse?
Is it sexual assault if I was crying, saying I didn’t want to keep going, and he didn’t let me stop?

I feel like I’m going crazy trying to make sense of it all. And even now, I feel guilty. I can’t bring myself to report anything—he’s already lost everything. He’s homeless because I left. But I’m still carrying all of this pain, and I don’t know what to do with it."
115,2,"I'm 20 and in the UK. I've dealt with emotional/psychological abuse from my parents ever since I can remember (that also used to be physical) and struggle with severe mental health challenges to this day that have left me almost completely non-functional and bedbound. Agoraphobia has left me mostly housebound since 2020, as I'd started getting panic attacks going out, and my 'solution' to this was to starve myself before leaving the house because emetophobia led me to believe my panic attacks were going to make me sick (which they never did, but I still worry about this happening every single time). Though this year my mental state has taken a turn for the worse - since this January I noticed various stimuli such as songs, TV scenes and things people say to me can lead me into a full blown panic. The list of triggers keeps growing and growing and it seems to be mainly things that remind me of being a scared little kid (which I didn't *panic* from then, but now somehow feel about a thousand times scarier when they cause me to have a panic attack).

It feels like since then my nervous system has been completely broken, as I get panic attacks a lot easier than I used to and a lot more often - nearly daily. My starvation strategy somewhat worked to keep me in school from 2021-2023, but in March this year I had a horrible panic attack outside the house even though I followed my 'rule' of starving, and rushed frantically to get home. I haven't left the house since, and my fear has just stewed and stewed to the point where it is now, where I'm in a constant state of fear and terror wondering what's next going to make me panic. It doesn't help that there's some issues I'm dealing with in real life that are exacerbating my anxiety, which is my dad getting a new partner and him arranging for her to visit for a whole week without asking me first (this happened last week, and felt really unreasonable considering my anxiety's at a point where I starve when anyone visits us), my mum moving out and the possibility of me having to move out with her because my dad's abuse has worsened since he got the partner. But I can barely think of those when I can hardly stand to simply exist without the constant terror. Everything in my life just feels completely terrifying and beyond what I'm capable of handling - I feel like I'm malnourished (which I am due to the emetophobia making me terrified of eating) and have been asked to lift a ten-tonne truck.

As for the panic attacks, I feel like I'm in a completely different state of mind when they occur. Suddenly every little thing in the environment becomes scary - the weather, the time of day, whatever people are talking about, everything that wasn't scary before suddenly is. When the panic attack wears off it mostly goes back to normal, except I worry about those things becoming scary again. I've been wondering if it's age regression or something similar because it makes me feel like a tiny little scared kid terrified of everything, but have been doubtful of that because I don't start talking/acting like a little kid when they happen. It's just like solely the fear part of the little kid takes over and nothing else, not the entire kid if that makes sense. I'm unsure what this is exactly, if these are panic attacks or emotional flashbacks or something else. Very little helps them in the moment; because I'm a freeze type I rely very heavily on games/TV as a distraction but when I'm frantic about starting up one of those to alleviate the panic it either doesn't work or makes it a bit worse. It's such an awful, torturous state of mind to be in, and for over six whole months it feels never-ending.

Basically to sum it up, I want to try to start healing and fix my broken nervous system (mainly in the context of being able to leave the house again) because I really can't take all this panicking from every little thing anymore, and more so because I'm going to have to move out to live with my mum but even just thinking about that makes me terrified especially since I haven't so much as gotten in a car since March. I'm too scared to start and don't know where to start either. I bought the books 'CPTSD: From Surviving to Thriving' and 'The Body Keeps the Score', but a combination of fear of getting triggered and poor motivation have made it hard to get through them. Any advice or insight would be very appreciated, thanks in advance."
116,1,"I was abused horribly by an ex. And I got diagnosed with ptsd. I have homicidal and suicidal ideation from the trauma. I'm on meds, I'm in psychiatric treatment as well. But one thing that plaques me is. I have this really really dark ""last resort"" plan in my head. If my life doesn't get to a place of functionality again. I have this dark urge to first murder my ex and then off myself afterwards. I'm waiting for money that is coming in. And I'm trying to date to find a partner, but with ptsd it's really hard. I have plans for my future and I try to focus on that, but I'm scared that either if one more big bad happens or if the money doesn't arrive (which it should), or if I just can't keep moving onward anymore. That I'll actually do it. But I dont want to live in a psyche ward, I'd rather be dead. Has anyone else experienced HI to this degree, following their trauma? 

Even more indepth, it's at a point before I WAS in a psyche ward, that I used to make sure I kept on where they lived worked and even studied their routines, I'd even let myself get seen at different times when I wasn't actually actively following them, so they thought THAT was me being sloppy.  When in reality I knew they moved apartments, knew when they changed jobs, knew when they went to lunch. 

I went to psyche and got on meds and got treatment. All the professionals seemed to realize it was REALLY BAD ptsd. But I still am worried. What If i snap? For real in the future? I genuinely worry I'll kill my abuser and then myself. Has anyone else pulled themselves out of this state? "
117,2,"Hi everyone,

I’ve recently been diagnosed with PTSD. Unfortunately, my GP can’t prescribe any specific treatment and the NHS waiting list means I’m unlikely to see a psychiatrist or therapist for at least two years. In the meantime I’m trying to manage on my own and could really use some advice, especially around sleep.

Once asleep, though, I experience intense parasomnias: thrashing around in bed; occasionally sitting bolt upright and screaming; once or twice lashing out at the person next to me. I’m worried I might accidentally hurt someone (or myself) during the night.

Alcohol and recreational drugs do knock me out, but they’re obviously terrible long-term options for mental and physical health—so I’d like to avoid them.


What I’m looking for:-

- Practical coping mechanisms or routines that have helped you (or someone you know) sleep more safely and soundly with PTSD.

- Tips that don’t rely on alcohol, weed, benzos, etc.

- Anything UK-specific—e.g., self-referral programmes, charities, or helplines I might have missed—would be a bonus.

I know everyone’s experience is different, but any suggestions, routines, or resources would be hugely appreciated while I wait for proper professional support.

Thanks in advance!

118,2,"Last night, Tehran was bombed by Israel and I was preparing to go to sleep right before I noticed the noises.

119,3,"I hope this makes sense. Is anyone else chronically ill and afraid to get better in a sense? I was always shrugged off for my pain and struggles as a teenager and young adult, until recently when things have gotten so bad that I need help with everything and use a wheelchair part time. Im finally being believed and people care about my pain. I struggle to exercise and its been peddled as the cure to all my problems for years now by both family and doctors. Of course exercise WOULD help but it wont cure me and I will still struggle or get hurt sometimes (we believe I have EDS). However I am afraid of being ignored or not being believed again. The worst is that doctors when youre young rarely investigate your issues unless they become chronic, and just throw pills/physical therapy at you for every thing. Theres this block to me exercising and its not just that it hurts+is tiring and that I hate it because its boring asf. Im afraid I will again struggle to be believed. I've become frustrated that I will probably be doing physical therapy for the rest of my life and that any break will cause me to backslide. I cant seem to prioritize it either because Im a single mom, looking for work, cant drive and basically homeless, i always feel theres something else that takes priority and i have so much to juggle.

123,2,"What’s up everyone — my name’s Austin. I’m 23, a lifelong football player, a college athlete. I’ve been on the field since I was 6. I was always strong — mentally, physically, emotionally. But everything changed the moment I lost my mom.

**The exact day I left the hospital after she passed, my body started reacting.** It was like my grief snapped something in me open. I had my first panic attack that night. I didn’t know what was happening — I thought I was dying. That was June 2024, and since then, nothing’s been the same.

# Trying to Be “Normal” Broke Me Even More

I kept trying to pretend I was okay. Went back to being a regular college kid. I even went on a spring break trip and binge drank for a week — trying to feel alive again.

That’s when my heart went into **AFib** for the first time. I ended up in the ER. Heart racing, dizziness, shortness of breath. I was terrified. Doctors said it was AFib and it could be stress-triggered. But I couldn’t believe stress and grief could destroy me like this.

Even after all that? I played a **full football season** through it. Hiding it. Chest aches, panic, PVCs, fear, shortness of breath — I didn’t tell anyone. I felt like I had to be the strong one. It nearly broke me.

# Here’s What I’ve Been Dealing With Since That Day:

* **Chest aches** (dull and sharp — especially left side/pec and under ribs)
* **Heart palpitations** (PVCs, skipped beats, flutters, pounding at rest)
* **Weird internal vibrations** (especially at night or after eating)
* **Stomach pressure, rib tension**, aches near sternum
* **Neck stiffness**, especially right side
* **Fear, panic, doom** hitting randomly
* **Rollercoaster feeling in my chest**
* **Scared to go too far from home**
* **Always hyper-aware of my heart rate**

# Tests I’ve Had (All Normal):

* **Echocardiograms** – March 2024 and March 2025 (normal structure and function)
* **Multiple EKGs** – occasional PVCs, sinus rhythm otherwise normal
* **Holter Monitor (3 days)** – no sustained arrhythmia detected
* **Stress Test** – cleared
* **Chest X-rays** – normal
* **Bloodwork** – all clear
* **Emergency room visits** – ruled out heart attack, PE, etc.

# What I’m On Now:

* **Zoloft** (SSRI for anxiety/depression)
* **Propranolol** (beta blocker for heart rate)
* **Hydroxyzine** (as-needed for panic)
* **Therapy** and processing grief slowly

# Why I’m Here:

Because I feel like I’m dying — not metaphorically, but **literally**. I wake up scared. I go to bed scared. Every ache, flutter, and skipped beat sends my mind spiraling. Some days I don’t feel like fighting anymore. I feel broken. Defeated. Like no one understands what I’m carrying inside.

But I’m not ready to give up.

I need other people who *get it*. People who’ve been through it — grief, AFib, anxiety, panic, unexplained symptoms — and are still fighting. I want to build a space where we hold each other up when it gets dark. Where we remind each other we’re not crazy, we’re not alone, and we’re not done yet.

If you’ve gone through:

* Panic attacks after grief or trauma
* AFib or other rhythm issues that scare the hell out of you
* Being told “it’s just anxiety” when you *know* it feels like more
* Getting clean test results but still feeling broken
* Losing someone and your whole body changing from that moment forward

Then I need to hear from you. Let’s talk. Let’s fight this thing together.

Athlete or not. Younger or older. All are welcome.

Let’s build something real.

124,3,"I worked at a mid-sized company in Utah for nearly four years. I never imagined I’d be speaking out like this, but here I am—still tangled in a state investigation because I had the nerve to request help for my mental health.

After struggling silently for months, I asked to temporarily work from home while adjusting to medication. HR told me it would have to go through “higher-ups,” which basically meant no. I was embarrassed and scared but pushed forward anyway and filed for FMLA.

That’s when things started to shift. My doctor didn’t want to disclose unnecessary details (which is protected), so my request was denied. I had to ask my therapist to resubmit everything, including deeply personal mental health diagnoses, just to be taken seriously.

Shortly after my FMLA was approved, I was put on a performance plan. Weeks later, I was fired.

I wasn’t fired for attendance. I wasn’t fired for breaking rules. I was fired for “missing a design deadline” and “ordering too much food” for a client meeting. After nearly four years of service, that’s what they gave me.

When I pushed back and filed a formal complaint, they offered money to settle it all quietly. I took a partial payment for the FMLA retaliation—but I never agreed to drop my discrimination claim. They’re now trying to say it was all covered. It wasn’t. And I’m done playing nice.

I’m still waiting on a ruling from the Utah Antidiscrimination Division. But even if nothing comes of it legally, I’m going to keep telling the truth. Because this happens every day—to people with PTSD, anxiety, bipolar, BPD. We get punished for asking for help.

This post might get buried, but I’m going to keep speaking. If you’re in a similar situation, I see you."

128,2,"I was recently diagnosed with PTSD after a horrible car accident. It’s hard to explain how much it changed me. Physically I was okay, but mentally it felt like something inside me cracked open. Ever since then I’ve had nightmares/flashbacks, panic attacks, and this constant feeling that I’m not safe. It’s like my brain is stuck in that moment and refuses to believe it’s over.

One of the worst parts is how afraid I am of cars now. I used to drive without even thinking. Now just being near a car makes my chest tighten. I’ve only gotten in a car maybe ten times in the last six months, and every time it feels like I’m walking into danger. Even short rides around the block leave me completely drained. It doesn’t feel rational, but my body reacts like I’m about to die. I’ve started exposure therapy in addition to regular therapy, and it’s helping a little, but it’s slow and exhausting.

What really messes with my head is how this one accident triggered all of it. I had a rough childhood - a lot of stuff I never really processed. There were things that by all accounts should have affected me deeply. But I never thought they did. I just moved forward. I wasn’t numb exactly, but I didn’t feel broken. I thought I was one of those people who “could just take it.”

Then this accident happened, and suddenly it’s like all the old pain came flooding back. Stuff I hadn’t thought about in years started showing up in dreams, in flashbacks, even in conversations. My brain decided this was the breaking point. Not the years of childhood trauma. It was this. And somehow that opened the door to everything else I thought I had escaped.

It’s so strange. How does the brain work like that? Why this event and not the others? Why does it hold on to pain for so long, only to unleash it when everything else feels like it should be stable? I didn’t even know I was carrying all of this until I couldn’t carry it anymore. It feels like my brain has been keeping secrets from me. Like it was saving everything for a moment when I finally slowed down long enough to hear it scream.

I’m in therapy now. I’m working on it. But it’s like trying to learn a language I was never taught — the language of my own fear, my own past, and my own mind. The brain is such a strange, powerful thing. It protects you and betrays you at the same time. I’m just trying to understand it, piece by piece, and hope it eventually learns to feel safe again.


I’m not sure what healing is supposed to look like. Some days it feels impossible, and other days I catch these brief moments of calm that make me think it might actually happen. I’m holding onto those moments, even if they’re small and far between.


I don’t have a big lesson or breakthrough to end this with. I’m just in it — confused, scared, tired, and slowly learning that healing isn’t a straight line. Maybe that’s enough for now."
129,1,"I got disgnosed with PTSD when I was 16 after I was in an abusive relationship with someone I thought was my friend. The effects the abuse left on me were so bad I had a psychotic break and was in and out of mental hospitals for two months. My abuser then told everyone I was the one that did the abusing and I lost all of my friends. When I tried to make new ones, they would find out about the lies and wouldn’t want to talk to me. On top of all of this when I reported it to the school, they did nothing and brought it to the police and that didn’t go anywhere. I was seen as the weird kid in my class from that point forward and everyone sided with them.

All of this completely fucked up my brain to where it negatively affected everything I did. When I tried to reach out for help to my parents, they said I need to learn to move on from things even after my ptsd diagnosis. Because of this I still haven’t gotten treatment and I GRADUATED that shitty high school this month. Now they really are pushing for me to move on from this and when I said I can do that with a therapist, they say they’ll look into it, but I know they haven’t. I don’t know what to do at this point cause I can only help myself so much and my ptsd still affects me so much today. I just want to be able to “move on” like they said."

Trying to adapt without knowing yet what I'll be left to work with.
I just don't see the point. Everything has a process, a reason to do things now. To start slow to be able to build things back up. Back up to what though.  I don't know yet, and it scares me. But I do know my life won't ever be the same, and I'm scared of what my new normal will look like.
I feel guilty my thoughts and feelings have gotten to this point.
I'm lucky to be alive, I know that. 
I just need to get through the now, and I can't.  

Edit: 
I didn't realise ptsd can affect memory and cognitive function until recently.  Forgetting how to do tasks, forgetting what I was about to do when I was literally on my way to do it. Mixing things up so much more. Even speaking a coherent sentence sometimes is difficult. Even struggling to remember what I did the day before. It's all a blur these days. I hate that I can't trust my own brain. "
136,1,"It’s funny I’ve talked about how I don’t want to go through the things that my mom went through. But in an attempt to not turn out like her I am turning out like her. Just at a younger age. She barely had friends . I don’t have any friends like at all. She had an unhealthy relationship with food . I’ve convinced myself that food is evil and feel guilty every time I consume something . I’m afraid to get on a scale. I will cancel appointments that I know will require me to weigh myself. She stayed at home because she was severely depressed and laid in her bed all day. Sometimes not even wanting to talk to my sister and I. What did I do for most of today? I’ve laid in my bed unless I needed to go to the bathroom. I slept but it was on and off because every time I closed my eyes I’m having nightmares and sometimes I can’t even tell what’s real or just a dream.  
I don’t talk to anyone until I go to work. I’ve isolated myself from everyone I’ve known.  Because they will never understand me , and I’m tired of feeling like I’m pressured to put on a show when I’m around others. I’m tired of having to face all the things I’m not or don’t have.  


The only difference between her and I is I’m working . I don’t say it in a insulting way but when I was a kid my mom never worked. I don’t know the story behind why. I just know my grandmother , mom, sister, and I all lived together at some point and my grandmother worked. I complained that as I got older I wished I could look up to my parents feel like I could become something. But I’m not proud of what I’ve become.  I don’t feel like I’m in control of anything. So now I’m just like them . I mean I’ve only met my dad maybe once or twice to the point that if you asked me to point him out in a line up I wouldn’t recognize him. My last thought I had about him is your the person that couldn’t show up to court for your child even when my mom was dead. I mean if you ever wanted to use her as an excuse as to why you couldn’t see me. She’s dead now! But he still didn’t show up to court to prevent me  from continuing to be in foster care. Because your car broke down. I mean it got so bad the attorney asked to be withdrawn from representing him. 

No matter what I do it’ll all come back. I was so happy yesterday. I mean I think I even said I’m so happy today like best day ever. Had my nightmares woke up today and felt like something dark was hovering over me. I’m convinced someone in my family did something really bad to someone and we are all cursed. 

Anyways I hate my life and I can’t wait to….well you get the point. "
137,1,"**Hi,**

Nearly two years ago, I developed PTSD due to a horrific terrorist attack. Since then, I’ve been unable to go to places like restaurants, supermarkets, shopping centers, or even walk around town or near busy roads. I’ve become extremely sensitive to noise—firecrackers, slamming doors, drilling, hammering, motorbikes, bouncing balls, blenders, people shouting, and so on. It’s all because of the PTSD, and it’s starting to make me feel deeply depressed.

I use BOSE Ultra earbuds with excellent active noise cancellation, so I’m either wearing them or staying at home with earplugs. But honestly, I feel like I can’t take this anymore.

I just want to go back to the person I was before the attack. Right now, I’m not independent—I rely on my mom or sister to do things like shopping for me because I can’t even imagine going into a store. I once tried an intensive outpatient program, but it wasn’t designed for PTSD, and there was constant construction noise and lawnmowers outside. It triggered me so badly that I would leave sessions in tears—so I eventually quit.

Has anyone experienced anything similar? What treatments or techniques have actually helped you?"
138,1,"Just need support today.  I've been nauseous all this week, so my restricting dieting had actually gotten worse.  It's now 1:30 and I've only eaten 2 ounces of cheese and a can of sugar-free monster and maybe 40 ounces of water.  

My muscles between my spine and right shoulder blade feels like someone is jabbing it with a screwdriver. 

I had EMDR yesterday and my t kept me over for 1/2 hour because I was crying so hard.
My self esteem is down to 0 again.

I just do not have a clue what to do with myself. My walking partner is away until Monday..and yes, I could go walking myself, but I am so afraid walking alone. 

I've been there for everyone but can't ask for support for fear of annoying them.

I just need some kindness. 

Edit:  thanks, guys. 
I drank a protein shake.
I got my massage cane out and have been pressing the spot on my back pretty hard. And I took some Tylenol.
I'm going to make dinner in a bit. 
If the back pain and nausea don't subside by the morning, I'm calling my nurse online. My doctor travels between 2 clinics, and I don't think she's local tomorrow. But my youngest said he'd drive me to the other clinic out of town.  


"
139,3,"I am a senior in college and I've really been struggling in my summer classes. Since experiencing several years of domestic violence and repeated sexual assault, I feel like my brain does not function in the way that it used to. Reading and writing have become extremely difficult for me. It feels defeating because I used to love reading and I used to have an easy time writing. It all felt very natural to me in the past, but now I feel like I'm fighting a war just to write a simple paper or to read an article for school. My professors have been kind enough to give me extra time to get assignments done. However, I am still having a really hard time getting my work done because the whole class is based on reading multiple long scientific articles and writing a few papers a week. The stress and anxiety I have surrounding my schoolwork has made me feel physically sick. In addition, my memory has turned to shit. It is so hard for me to watch lectures and maintain focus. Even when I am able to focus, I can't retain the information presented for very long at all. It is like anything I read or hear goes in one ear and out the other. It is very scary to me at times that my memory has become this way. Is there anything I can do to not struggle so much with reading and writing and completing school? Is there anything I can do to improve my focus or memory? Is my brain going to be stuck like this forever? "
140,0,"Has anyone gone through a long period of healing and discovered happy memories on the other side, that had been buried under all the trauma? 

If so, how are you handling the overwhelm of that emotional experience? "
141,1,"Before reading i'd like to say sorry for this being a little poorly written and all over the place. I've been out of an abusive relationship for 8 months now, and feel that I haven't made any tangible progress in healing and/or feeling like a person again. For the longest time I completely isolated myself and was fully at the whim of my abusers words. Seeing as I already have low-self value to begin with, and am more of a timid person, I was a very easy target to coerce and manipulate — leading me to believe that I was the sole issue, and that I deserved the abuse. I readily took the blame, and just phased out of my life, as it felt like the safest and least painful route. It was only once I started speaking to a therapist and close friends that I realized what actually happened to me. However, I still feel an overwhelming sense of guilt. I've been made to feel guilty by many means, and that feeling has not abated. In the 8 months i've had hurtful, defamatory, insulting posts made about me every few days, if not more often, by my abuser. I've stopped looking at them — i'm scared to check at this point honestly — but they still have a permanent place in my mind. When i'm trying to sleep, i'll think about all the insults that were thrown at the wall, all the ways that I was dehumanized, all the ways I was made to feel worthless, and all the ways that my character was brutally dissected under a microscope. My sleep isn't as bad as it used to be — I can stay asleep for longer and don't have to drink as often to initially get to sleep — but the night terrors and replays of the past make it such a fucking chore. In my interpersonal relationships it's been very difficult as well. I don't necessarily think the new people in my life have bad intentions, they seem like lovely people, but I am legitimately terrified of them. I can't trust them in the slightest. I become really worried that they'll abuse me, or that they're pretending to like me, or compare them to my abuser, or even feel unworthy of their company. I don't want to squander what are potentially good future relationships — my ""support group"" had already been stripped enough already via my abuser turning people against me with lies about my character. But how can I have friends when I feel that I don't even deserve to exist anymore? I can't really eat either. Whenever I try to eat, the insults and past events come back up, and it simply doesn't work. The pain in my body prevents me from getting anything down. I've lost over 40 pounds in the last 8 months, and i'm still losing more weight quite steadily, which has been starting to cause me health issues. My sharpest weight drop-off was in November, and I needed to spend some time in the hospital. I feel like I perpetually live in a state of everything that was once done to me, constantly feeling hurt and afraid. Time doesn't feel like a linear passage, it has all blended into a single dot, that encapsulates all of the ways i've been harmed. If that makes any sense (?). It may be June, but I exist in December or January, with all of my naïve and ill-advised suicide attempts, and my tumultuous emotional state. I like to lie to myself and others and say that my suicidal ideation is no longer there, but it still is, full-force, undoubtedly. I've just chosen to neatly put it away because I feel like that's what's expected of me, I didn't want to be a burden, and I wanted to adhere to a ""normal"" healing process. For that same reason I haven't even mentioned any of this with my therapist since February (with the exception of mentioning a panic attack I had due to finding out my abuser was stalking my social media). I'm not comfortable with therapists, and i've never been honest with one before in my life. I was honest earlier in this situation because if I wasn't, it's very likely I would've 100% killed myself. I needed to get the thoughts out. But now, it's just so easy to beat around the bush and not bring up what truly ails me, even if it's to my detriment. I truly, truly, detest the fact that i'm so stuck in this state. Metaphorically, I feel like i'm being physically beaten, like there's sandpaper on my skin, like my head is being crushed, like my stomach is collapsing, like my lungs are being depleted of air. It's truly no way to live, and I don't understand what I can do to feel less consumed by this. I have been diagnosed with PTSD, my therapist knows it and suggests EMDR, and i'm very skeptical of it, but I would literally try anything if it meant eradicating all of these feelings. I'm seriously worried that I may harm and/or kill myself if these feelings continue and I don't want to do that after having gone this far. "
142,2,"idk if this is the right place, but i'm going through one of the worst patches of my life and im just trying to dissect and figure myself out 

short and quick to the question:
could i have possibly been exposed to SA as a child if ive constantly felt intrusive thoughts specifically as me as a child, or could it maybe be OCD intrusive thoughts? 


ever since ive know of sex and masturbation (which was pretty normal/older [14-16]), i've always had this very very intense fantasy as me as a young girl being assaulted by and older man. specifically what's always come to mind was an adult male teacher assaulting me. but i have absolutely no memory of this or anything close happening to me in real life when i was this age 

i am NOT diagnosed, but i do have some OCD/paranoid tendencies. such as very strong urges to say slurs at work, swerving off the road and killing myself, convincing myself im a pedo, things of that nature. i've never talked to anyone abt it cause i don't want to sound like im self diagnosing but ive had OCD ""intrusive"" thoughts since i was 11. it's just embarassing. i remember having panic attacks at 11 thinking my parents were going to kill my younger brother or my parents were going to die. they know about that but once i got older and the thoughts started getting more ""inappropriate"" i stopped talking abt them

"
143,2,"It’s rare I go a night without ptsd nightmares. Sometimes, I can shake them off, but others are so terrible, sometimes I’m left sobbing all day after I wake up. They’ve been that bad every night this week so far. I’m literally sobbing right now because I’m scared to go to sleep and have more nightmares.


I have a calming nighttime routine and I’ve already tried every med my doc can prescribe for ptsd nightmares. I’m not looking for long term solutions (mostly because none are working). I just need to know how I can calm myself down enough to go to bed without crying myself to self to sleep, scared and shaking.

I have too much to get done this week to just avoid sleep for as long as I can like I sometimes do."
144,1,"TW: very brief mention of substances 

Edit: I am diagnosed with PTSD and my ex emotionally abused me.

I was absolutely fine and now I’m being hit with terrible feeling. They started creeping up on me months earlier. When it first hit me that it was over I was horribly depressed and breaking out in cystic acne, I then I became obsessive and furious and now I feel sick and I’m afraid to see them, not because I’m afraid of them but because I’m afraid of the feelings that I’m getting. 

How common is it only to be getting this 6 months later? I know once the dusts settles then you tend to feel worse now since you can actually process what happened but it’s so horrible. I’ve been through stuff like this before but I don’t know how to be in this feeling anymore now that I don’t do substances and my personality disorder is more or less in remission. I was always self-destructive, angry and self loathing but now it’s different and I just don’t know what to do."
145,2,"I had a situation a few months ago where I started having flashbacks to a past event and threw up not once, but twice. Is this unusual or has this happened to anyone else on here before? "

TW: CSA

Has anybody ever came out to their siblings about the sexual abuse happened to them. If so, how did that go, did it help you ? and did you ever regret it?"
147,2,"Hi! Do you guys get dreams/nightmares? How do you cope with them? (If they’re bad)

I’m nearing 19 and have dealt with a ptsd diagnosis since 15. I’ve since learned how to manage and I don’t deal with mental issues often anymore. 

However, occasionally, I’ll get very graphic/realistic nightmares. Those nightmares usually mess me up pretty bad because of how immersive they feel and take me days to snap out of. 

I’m basically frozen for an hour or more after waking up just to ground myself in reality. It’s a big time inconvenience when waking up early to work/study. Going to bed at reasonable times and not overthinking before bed helps me."
148,3,"TW: descriptions of terror-filled events, medical emergency, significant psychological trauma


I don’t know if there’s a better place to post this but I’m really struggling to find professional help after what I went through and I had to move back in with family that isn’t healthy for me either. I accidentally did trauma regression by myself and it was a lot. I came across groundbreaking mental health revelations that I’m uncomfortable with. I broke my trust in myself and started to reject myself for having knowledge that felt forbidden. I’m trying to process it in a better way on my own but I can only do so much. I ended up retraumatized and it didn’t take long after that before entering a brief period of psychosis. I was so weakened by stress that I couldn’t do much to help myself other than stay locked in my room. All of my friends discarded me and no one visited me when things got really bad. I FaceTimed my grandma to see my cats and I felt nothing anymore. Shortly after I had to call an ambulance because of chest pain and what felt like “ballooning”. The ambulance didn’t even stop in front of my house they parked behind a construction site and they didn’t know where I was. I pissed myself without knowing when I walked over to them clutching my chest and I was very frantic.

I’ve been in a loop of narcissistic abuse from my family and I went homeless to try to break the cycle. Just to end up in another narcissist’s hands and then another one immediately afterwards. I only had a couple days of a break before I found myself getting consistently triggered. Life feels really bleak sometimes and I don’t know how I’m still alive. Just in the most recent situation I feel like I probably should have died like 5 times."
149,1,"I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this, if it’s not please point me in the right direction. 

I’ll give you a little back story, my partner was groomed and and forced into a marriage she didn’t want or consent to; this person (person A) also was physically, mentally, financially abusive and would use rape as a punishment against her. 

She was also raped and kidnapped by another individual (person B)  multiple times when we first started seeing each other, she initially told me this was consensual and that she wanted it. She later explained to me everything that was happening with both individuals, and how she was forced to tell me things.

Person A had a little cross over as she was stuck living with him but she was always really honest with that, she went to the police and got an annulment as the court agreed it was unlawful. 

Person B, attacked her on a night out and invited her over to “apologise” and then raped her and threatened to tell people it was her fault and make sure that she didn’t get anything from the separation she was going through. He then threatened her with bringing me into it and that he would do the same to me, she went back to his a few times each time he would keep her tied up and hurt her, as she was scared and he did the same thing each time threatening her more and more.

It’s been two years since this all ended and the police were brought in.

I have spent the last two years supporting my partner and her family through this, and honestly forgot about myself a little bit and now they are all in a better place with it I have been left behind. My partner is ready to leave this behind and feels like she’s in a good place , but I still get hurt and upset by it all. I still end up bringing stuff up because I’m hurting.

I believe everything she has said but it’s been tough as there was a narrative given initially and sometimes that gets mixed in with the truth and I don’t always know what is correct, so sometimes have to ask for clarification which I know hurts her when I have to say something like “you once told me person B took you on a date” and the response I will get is “i lied about that because I didn’t want you to think I was weak” or something along those lines. 

I felt for along time I was the “last choice” but she confessed she had loved me for years but was unable to do anything without getting hurt. 

I feel like I failed her and I’m so scared it will happen again. 

I keep having nightmares of one of the times.
She was meant to come to mine but never showed up, I then got sent a photo of her and person B she looked pale and scared, with the caption “I hate you and don’t want anything to do with you anymore I’m not coming back, you won’t see me again” and I feared the worst that he was going to kill her, I didn’t know at the time but I was so scared.

When I confronted her about that, she said she didn’t know about it and he had kept her tied up and was beating her until she passed out raped her and then while she was disassociating took the photo and sent it to me deleting the message from her phone. 

I have taken all the therapy offered from the police and charities but i just want to be rid of all this sadness and fear.
"
150,0,"I was wondering, as i read tons of reddits here of how people are treating their ptsd and their ways to do it and their progress, and honestly, there are stories that made me feel overwhelmed because of the impressive progress and the hope they had given me

But then, I started wondering if what i was doing was wrong, i want to tell someone my story, and tell them what i did, and what i had to go through to be where i am right now, and tell me if what i did was a progress indeed, and if it’s considered something, or a better way to put it into words, if it was valuable or valid to feel what i’m feeling now, i hope anyone who’s reading this gets what i’m trying to say."
151,2,"‏In 2022, my grandmother passed away two months later, my grandfather passed too.
‏ In 2023, things were okay there were personal challenges in university and all, but I wasn’t dealing with anxiety, fear, or intrusive thoughts the way I am now.

‏then, around mid 2024, my aunt passed away. of course it was sad but it still felt bearable.
‏ Life continued I wasn’t obsessing over anything, or feeling paranoid. But one day I took a nap in the afternoon and had a terrifying dream filled with symbols of death, like signs that someone in the family might die my grandmother, grandfather, and aunt all appeared or were mentioned In the dream, people had seen them before they died. I woke up in full panic.

‏that afternoon was terrifying even though the AC was on and the windows were closed, I was drenched in sweat. My body felt like it was on fire from the fear. That night, we had a family gathering while I was doing my sister’s hair it felt like my blood was boiling I told one of my cousins about the dream and while the fear felt real it was still light compared to what came next I just started to worry whenever the person from the dream was late I’d call them even if they were usually late.

‏then, about a month later, we traveled with my uncle’s wife. One night at dinner, the entire conversation was about death dreams about people dying, stories of deaths, how her sister sensed something before she passed, and all the dreams she’d had. That night, back at the hotel, my heart was pounding so loud I felt like someone in another country could hear it. I laid in bed thinking, “This is it. There’s nothing I can do anymore.”

‏When we got back from the trip, I was okay for a couple of weeks until I had my first panic attack. I was so scared. My heart was racing, and I even threw up from the fear. I kept pacing around until I finally calmed down and fell asleep. About a week later, I took another nap I don’t remember what time—and from that point on, everything just broke I stopped laughing. I stopped talking. I barely spoke to anyone.

‏Now my days look like this: 13 hours on my phone, 9 hours asleep, and maybe 2 hours doing anything else eating, watching something on my laptop, washing dishes. I completely avoid my relatives. Just hearing their names or going to places that remind me of them sends me into panic. I feel scared when people talk about my grandparents or my aunt.

‏Before my aunt passed, we visited her on a Friday she was sick. She passed the following tuesday That kind of timing haunts me. One time my mom invited some relatives over and I nearly lost it from fear I was terrified that something bad would happen again.

‏even when my aunt passed, we had some online orders arrive that same day Now I avoid ordering anything at all. I’m scared of receiving packages. Even cake I used to love it, but we brought one with us to my aunt when we visited, and now I can’t even look at cake.

‏one time, my uncle’s wife hosted a small family gathering. Most people couldn’t come, but we went with my cousins. I was terrified the entire time. I didn’t know how to say no, so I just went. Even the kids and the food they brought made me anxious. I know that sounds harsh, but I couldn’t control it. At the gathering, I tasted one bite from my sister’s plate and nearly threw up from the anxiety I’m scared to talk to them I get anxious when my family talks to them I get tense, easily irritated I snap at my siblings without meaning to.

‏one day we celebrated something for my sister with a cake. Now I’m afraid that something bad will happen a week later just like it did with my aunt.

‏I don’t go out anymore. I spend my days in my room, under the covers, with my phone I don’t talk to anyone. I don’t see anyone. I’m not exaggerating one time, my sister needed something and said, “It feels like I haven’t talked to you in forever.” my mom is really upset with how I’ve been acting.

‏my period used to be irregular, and now it’s even worse My face looks pale, with dark circles under my eyes my brother once said I should get bloodwork done I’ve become moody, irritable, and I don’t enjoy anything anymore not shows, not sports, not the things I used to love Spiritually, I feel empty. Even writing this now, I’m scared. I’m scared that something bad will happen just because I’m talking about it.

‏my sleep is a mess I wake up and fall back asleep over and over. Every time I wake up, I have scary dreams. And even if I can’t remember the dream, I still wake up terrified afraid I dreamed something bad. I used to get excited when my mom suggested going to the mall Now I say no without hesitation.

‏even when I drink juice or something simple, I think, “What if I die after this?” I bought games to help with stress, but I’m scared to play them what if I die after playing? I know it sounds silly, but this is how I think now. I’m sorry if this is too much, but I only shower once a week now I feel like if I shower more, something bad might happen. I constantly ask myself, “What’s the point of studying, working, exercising?”

‏I get scared by the simplest things people say. Just today, my brother joked, “Where have you been? On vacation?” because I never go out And now I’m terrified why did he say that?

‏I never used to bite my nails Now they don’t even reach the ends of my fingers.

‏I procrastinate everything I get nothing done when I see posts or tweets about death, I panic I feel like they’re signs meant specifically for me every day I think, “Maybe I’ll die soon,” and I get scared. I’m scared to laugh. I’m scared to enjoy anything. I’m even scared to talk to my own family. I feel like if I ignore the fear, what I’m afraid of will actually happen.

‏I wake up at least four times every night. I can’t sleep unless I play a relaxing video on YouTube just to stop my mind from spiraling.

‏I’m scared of the simplest things one day, my mom made some specific dishes, and I can’t explain the thoughts that overwhelmed me. Later, my dad suggested ordering food from outside, and again I panicked why would he suggest that when we don’t usually do it?

‏even when the person from that first dream just coughs, I panic I feel like I’m going to lose my mind from the fear that something will happen to them.

‏my sister and I are supposed to be learning how to drive our relatives are excited for us because it’s something useful, and in general, I used to be really excited about it too now, I just say, “Let her learn and get her license, and I’ll figure it out later.” one time, we were sitting at the dinner table with some relatives, and the topic of driving came up. Someone asked if we had started learning, and we said yes. Then they asked my mom, “Which one of them do you think is more excited and will drive first?” My mom answered with my sister’s name. The person seemed surprised and said, “Really? I thought my name would be the one.” Everyone knows I used to be the most excited about it—the most responsible, the most eager. But now? I’m just… off. Like a shell of the person I used to be.

‏I feel full of fear, full of thoughts like I’m breathing through the eye of a needle.
‏I feel hopeless I feel scared like there’s no future for me.
‏Is this really my life now?
‏Is the end really this close?

‏I’m sorry for the long message… I’m just really, really scared.

152,3,"I was diagnosed with PTSD about 2 years ago after an assault. It’s taken me this long to start to gain awareness of how deeply this has affected me. I pushed it down for a long time. Within the last couple of months I’ve been working with a lawyer to press charges which has been very triggering for me. 

I was in a deeply toxic work environment which I am now out of. A lot which has been repressed for a long time is coming up now, and I am deeply, deeply exhausted. I am currently bedridden and have a family member dropping off all my meals. I tried to leave my apartment yesterday but got triggered. 

I also have bipolar disorder and have had catatonic and depressive episodes which have left me bedridden, but this feels different. My mood is stable, but nowhere but my bed feels safe. 

Has anyone else been through this stage? Does it seem like a symptom of PTSD? What is your experience? "
153,2,"Was sexually harassed at a mental health program about a month and a half ago which stirred reminders of my SA that happened 8 years ago. 

As of two or three days ago, whenever I see my boyfriend, who has always been my safe space, my stomach drops and I flinch when he even comes near me. 

I think I started talking about both incidents to my partner the other day (SA & SH) because I felt it weighing on my chest heavily. Ever since, I have an awful feeling in my stomach when I hug him. He has always been loyal, so I know that it isn’t my intuition and is most likely a trauma response as I have had some flashbacks to the SA. I explained how I was feeling to my boyfriend about being touched and he has been very supportive and respectful of my boundaries. 

I want to get rid of this gnawing feeling in the pit of my stomach and be able to hug and love my partner normally again. Therapy isn’t an option right now, though I will resume within the next month or so, any tips on how to cope with this and get this to go away in the meantime?"
154,2,"There are times where I feel easily disturbed by noises or smells or whatever, especially when I am at home. It feels like something is intruding my private space. And I tend to react very intense to this, like intense anger or panic or despair. 
Sometimes I wonder if I am still looking for an enemy in the outside, as if I am transferring or projecting my inner trauma in the present. Maybe because I can not confront ""the enemy"" in my past and instead of working through this I'm looking for a new battlefield to distract myself with. 
Right now I'm terrorizing my neighbour, because I can not stand the intense smell coming out of his appartment. And I feel ashamed about it. And I wonder if my reactions are justified or if I am overreacting.

Kind of hard to explain, but I hope you got the idea. Anyone experiences something similar?"

I had been reaching out to my support team and a friend about the DV for a bit, and I snapped when I knew I'd been assaulted in my sleep. I truly believed he would kill me. 

When I called emergency services, I ended up getting scheduled for reporting everything he was doing to me. Because I was distraught and he wasn't. 

The hospital never told me I was pregnant. There's no other possible way I could've gotten pregnant, but either I had a miscarriage or they used the tribunal to perform an abortion without my or my families knowledge or consent. I was unconscious most of the time I was in hospital.

Someone from my primary car team looked at the bHCG results from when I initially went into hospital and told me the levels indicated I was at least 3 weeks pregnant at the time.

That means I was assaulted at least twice in the more recent period of time in my sleep. I had no idea it had happened more than once. I only knew about the more recent time because of the state I woke up in.

Not remembering any of it is killing me. It's left me in a painful place of being completely terrified because even though he moved out, he didn't leave the area, and desperately missing my best friend and not wanting it to be true.

The police didn't document that me and my family disclosed SA to them. The hospital said I was paranoid, and delusional in the discharge paperwork. They said that despite having the positive pregnancy test. They came to that decision because I wouldn't do another kit to have it sit on a shelf forever after being poked, proded and exposed.

I wish I could remember. I wish I had something tangible to process. I'm left with nothing but fear, confusion, anger and grief. "
156,2,"I was diagnosed with PTSD about a month ago after losing my mom in a traumatic way in January. I’ve been put on a couple of different medications and they’ve mostly stopped the panic attacks, and nightmares, but I’ve realized that my mental health spirals QUICKLY when I’m by myself - doesn’t happen but every so often when I’m with others. I used to be someone who  cherished my alone time, and now I literally dread it. Ive had panic attacks if I’m alone in the office, if I have a day off and my partner goes to work. But people’s lives can’t stop because I panic. Anyone else experience this or have any ideas on why it’s happening or how to just get through it 😩"
157,2,"A couple of years ago, I almost died from being drugged and raped on vacation in Cuba. Sometimes, when I am having a flashback, I hear voices speaking in Spanish. I don’t really know what they’re saying. I also hear my mom sometimes, who was there on the vacation with me. I know logically that no one else is around but the voices are so clear, and then once my flashback fades they disappear again. Has this happened to anyone else?? How did you deal with it? For me, they are really frightening during the flashback. "
158,2,"Tw for mention of SA.

This is kinda ridiculous. Did this happen to anyone else? When I was a kid I would pick up moths, but I can't nowadays. They have that little powder, the feeling of it on my skin is really distressing. I don't know if it's because of my trauma (SA), but after it I had trouble with certain textures and touch. I always loved insects, but i guess i changed.

I freeze when I see a moth, i don't like their erratic flying either, and they are so small i wont notice if they are already on my skin, and i get really paranoid when I see a moth, like the next day it's probably still around. I don't like killing insects, so I just avoid where the moth is.

I just saw a moth resting on my courtains, which I had to close. I didn't. It started flying around and i almost had a panic attack, that's why i'm saying this sounds sooo ridiculous. I ran to my room, i just hope the moth is gone by tomorrow."
159,1,"At the beginning of the year, I had a complete mental breakdown and almost tried to commit suicide. I was in an outpatient program for a month and a half and was diagnosed with complex PTSD. Once leaving treatment, I started EMDR. I’ve completed about eight weeks of EMDR treatment at this point. I’m also medicated and am still adjusting meds with my psychiatrist. 

When do I actually start to feel better? I still  feel like I’m just surviving. I don’t feel that I’m moving the needle in a positive direction for the long-term. What is a realistic expectation? Most days I still feel deeply sad, anxious, overwhelmed, and I’m often angry. "
160,1,"does it? i was diagnosed officially last year but ive had the symptoms for about three years. it only gets worse with time. i avoid therapy because talking about it and doing their little processing tricks doesnt work. its an endless nightmare and no matter what i do i cant escape it, and everyones like ""its not a forever diagnosis--- BECAUSE youll learn to deal with it"". so ill have it forever still? does it get better? does it not?"
161,0,"For anyone that's tried CPT (cognitive processing therapy)* (recommended by the woman who diagnosed me) what does it look like? From what she described, it alters how your brain views memories and has 12 steps, but other than that what do the sessions and work look like? Everything on google is still very vague. 

Thanks!

163,2,"So, my nightmares have gotten bad enough in the past year that I hurt myself in my sleep. I have already gotten ‘baby-proofing’ materials for the corners of my nightstands after I gave myself a concussion. But the other night I was in a nightmare thinking I was getting hurt and I tried fighting back- except really I was fighting back with the iron bar at the foot of my bed 🙃. I went to the ER thinking I broke my foot, but only covered up and down in contusions. This bar is pretty thin. The other baby proofing materials, I don’t think would fit around it properly lol. Does anyone have any ideas??? Especially one that will really STICK…I’m a pretty resilient kicker. It’s a metal bar about the size of a really thick pen ?? Idk how else to describe it"
164,3,"Hi there, my husband and I were hit by a drunk driver on our way home 4 days ago. There was nobody behind us, and then BOOM someone smashed into us with a force of a bomb. And then they hit us again.. which sent us off the road and into a ditch and then airborne into another ditch. Our car is totalled, so was there’s, they never even came to check on us. 

We are BOTH not ok. Dealing with a lot right now, and part of the mental issues I’m having (along with anxiety, depression, flashbacks, reliving etc) is that I’m digging for everything. Maybe because it came literally out of nowhere? And I’m trying to process how? Why?? What??! Somehow we crashed in front of two businesses on a road where your chances of that happening are slim. And I was able to retain footage from both places. Seeing the footage (although at night still clear enough) makes me sick and anxious and everything, but I keep watching?? I just need to try to process everything I guess. But now after talking to many people about how bad of shock I was in during everything (including the 911 call, I was apparently screaming crying shaking shivering etc). I have now requested under the freedoms act the actual 911 recording. 

Why? Why am I like this? Is this normal to be like this after something so terrifying and life changing? Am I crazy for trying to do this? I know I def need to talk to a psychologist about this trauma, cause MAN am I traumatized.. But figured I’d ask here for what others think, support etc! "
165,2,"(I'm 13, so I'm sorry if I say something immature or disrespectful.)  
A couple days ago, my best friend I've had since the 2nd grade told me he got flashbacks to what he just described as ""A traumatizing event"". The more I think about this, the more worried yet kind of curious I get. I don't know how I could go about being respectful about things. He might not want to talk about it if I ask, but what if I trigger something without knowing? I also realized he says he has night terrors and insomnia problems, which I hear are both symptoms."
166,2,"I went to the doctors recently talk about my PTSD. He was running like an hour late and also not my usual doctor which already made it harder to open up, but when I asked about ways of getting an official diagnosis he said there was none and that is, if you have the symptoms you have itis it true or was he just trying to push me away because he was running late?"
167,2,"i hope this is the right flair aha. wont delve into too much detail of my trauma situation and also its really stupid but i was wondering if this happens to anyone else. 

to start, since childhood i am very specific about layouts of my room, i.e. my desk always has to be in one place and my bed in another and i seldom move my furniture around (no ocd here-just a preference), but when i do, it sticks. 

when i was in a really bad spot last year (that also subsequently led to my diagnosis), i had moved my bed to another side of my room. throughout my trauma this room layout stayed the same and after i got better i moved my bed back to its previous spot, so as to ''forget'' or more so push out the bad things that happened to me by adjusting the things around me to how they were before xyz happened, ie deluding myself into thinking it never happened. 

i have since comprehended what happened and ive been working on myself (its going great so far!) by myself and with a therapist, stopped trying to ''forget'' it and instead accept it, but the issues do not stop there. 

now, theres repairs happening for my room and the side of my room where the bed was is not all that available so i have to move it back to The Spot, to put it. the idea of it itself made me extremely panicked and upset, leading to several panic attacks, but now even sleeping in the bed, that is in The Spot, has my nightmares intensifying. and its so stupid because its JUST a position of my bed in my room but it leads to all sorts of negative emotions, episodes and panic attacks. i dont know what to do and i cant even really tell anyone else about it because it genuinely sounds idiotic to put it lightly. :,,)"
168,1,"Just had another session of therapy. I want to say first off that my therapist is wonderful. I don’t blame her for this at all. It’s me. 

I cried for basically the whole time, cried afterwards in my car, and I’m still sitting on my couch crying. Anytime I speak about anything that I’m feeling, or anything I’ve gone through, my fears, my nightmares, I get emotional and feel like shit for the whole day. I don’t know how to explain it. 

Anyone else? "
169,1,"I have horrific nightmares about my trauma but i also have wonderful fantastical dreams between all the nightmares. Sometimes i have continuations of those dreams over multiple sleeps like a mini series and its wimsical and fantatsical and beautiful. Stuff you could write books about. 

I've been on Prazosin only 2 nights now. 1mg. I'm on a 5 day trial run of the medication. I am very sensitive to psych meds and doses so we start very low. 

So far, when i sleep, all i'm getting is a black nothingness. It feels cold and makes me not want to go to sleep more than the nightmares ever did. It feels so SO empty. Like a vast void of nothingness. And not even like a ""don't remember my dream"" emptiness but like i go to sleep and its black and then i wake up and feel empty. 

I see my prescriber on Friday and I don't know what to do or what to say. I was having nightmares all the time, multiple times a week if not once a day (i nap a lot). Most all of those nightmares involve natural disasters or Firearms. 

But this nothingness feels so much worse. 

Anyone else deal with this on Prazosin? Did the good dreams eventually come back? I don't think i can handle this empty void at night. "
170,2,"Long story short, recently diagnosed with ptsd and asked why. She said “one of your family members had you at gun point, another woke you from sleep with a knife over you, and two others sa’d u”. I said “Fair, but since non of those events cause me noticeable stress (post traumatic STRESS disorder-ptsd) why did you say I have it.” Got some round about answer but still don’t really understand how since it doesn’t cause STRESS witch is literally in the name of the diagnosis.                    

Thx for answers"
171,2,"Definitely a longshot but has anyone else had so much difficulty with finding work that they simply can't? Due to the experience I triggered my CPTSD initially (held at gun-point), I can't work in a traditional, physical space. On top of that I experience pretty severe panic attacks when interacting with others via voice, like phone calls, to the point I can't work things like a call-center position. Any advice? I'm at my wit's end in regards to searching and have even filled out both FAFSA and potential disability in hopes of finding some sort of middle ground of schooling or assistance in the meantime.

172,2,"cw : shootings , death , bodies 


so back in october i was in a mass shooting that left me with severe ptsd. lately ive been having “flashbacks” of the dead bodies. but i never actually saw them. i saw a video on accident once that filmed them but the flashback is as if i saw them while it was happening. is this normal? usually i just remember the feelings of terror and the fear of not being able to find my friends and being alone and the moment i knew what was happening etc etc etc but until recently it hadn’t been false memories. i’ve had nightmares since it happened about gore unrelated to the actual event but this is different. i know what the victims look like from articles and i can’t stop picturing it in my mind, their bodies on the ground. i don’t know what to do. these come out of seemingly no where sometimes "
173,2,"i dont have the crazy vivid flashbacks that movies show but i have much more faint memories and hear muffled voices. i remember extremely specific moments of my childhood but they have very faint detail. i remember being choked by my mom in the hallway and how angry she looked but i dont remember what grade that was. same thing with a specific phrase she said to me i hear it over and over on loop when shes mad at me and it brings me to tears eventually from anger, i excuse myself to the bathroom and leave the water running to no one hears my temper tantrums i get so embarrassed. i even have odd sensations throughout my head and neck the same way i used to bang the back of my head against walls when i was little or the way my mother would grab me by the collar of my shirts to choke me but i only feel these when im extremely upset or hear her yelling and screaming. is this neurological and have to do with brain damage from my head injuries or is this ptsd?"

Working on getting a claim sent to the VA for some somewhat recently diagnosed ptsd. Been ignoring signs and symptoms for several years now, but I read the statements from my mom and my ex, and... I don't know.. Never felt this broken before. Not broken in a cute way, just.. Not working or existing correctly I guess.

Sometimes I wonder if it was worth it, or if I deserve being like this.

I think I'm just feeling sorry for myself and venting into the void while up later than I should be. Got another month til the VA has my counseling appointment, so just at a dark place while waiting."
175,3,"Hello all! I have CPTSD and I am back in college as a 45 year old. I have accommodations for several things that have made a great difference but I have a new situation that I have no idea how to resolve or what to even ask for to help. 

I’m in a 5 week microbiology class for summer right now and it’s not my normal campus. This campus is old and poorly lit. The lab is small and has no windows, not even in the door. The combination of restrictive lab coat, gloves, goggles that fog up and the room triggered a full episode Thursday. I’ve already been having to take Xanax just to go to class. Anyone have suggestions for what could help make this better in terms of accommodations?

Edit for update: thank you to each of you for your support and suggestions! I now have a fan with a light in the class, better goggles that don’t fog,my iPad in a ziplock bag to use, switched with my lab partner so I’m on the outside with a direct exit, professor leaves the lab door open so I can see out, my water is right outside on a table that I can go get a sip whenever I need to, and with my iPad I can set regular alarms to check in with myself to see where I’m at. 
I just took a test on Monday that I had gotten 35% on last time I attempted this class and led to me dropping. I’m happy to report I got a 91% on the test and I’m sitting at an 85%! Only 2 weeks to go and I can do this!"
176,2,"I was diagnosed with PTSD today and immediately the first line of treatment they recommended was Zoloft or Mirtazapine. I declined for now, as I’d prefer to focus on therapeutic ways to manage first. 

My current dilemma is that I am seeing a therapist that is not a trauma therapist. I like her, but she is recommending we start DBT (don’t know what this entails). I am thinking I should maybe switch providers to a trauma based therapist to help with this?

I kind of want to see if anyone on here has had luck with managing their PTSD without medication? Any luck with dbt? Any difference you felt between a standard therapist and a trauma certified therapist? What about any experience with EMDR?

I want to get better but I have no experience with any of this and neither does anyone I know. I feel like I could use some accounts of lived experience right now. "

179,0,"Hi Everyone, this post is a bit different— but I hope some of you might find it helpful or at least hopeful. 
I have struggled with ptsd for about four years now. Realllyyy struggled. Constant panic episodes, isolation, night terrors, the whole nine. I felt really alone in this for a long time; I (now 21, F) was in my late teens during most of the acute adverse events, and I was completely under the impression that ptsd was something only veterans dealt with. 
This time was really lonely and scary, and I often considered giving up. I eventually met my therapist who completely saved my life, I truly owe everything to her. She helped me rediscover my empathy and desire to learn and help others, and eventually decide to go back to university. I realized I wanted to become a psychiatrist, so I started volunteering at a local VA hospital to gain some experience working with patients before applying to medical school (next cycle).
I have found immense joy, healing, and fulfillment from volunteering with veterans. After being so isolating and afraid of people (especially men) for so long, I was incredibly surprised at how much more connected I feel to most of the patients I see at the VA than anyone else. I don’t know if there is some subconscious or innate inner understanding between people who have experienced life changing trauma (I am not trying to compare traumas or events at all, I realize each persons experience is unique and context dependent) but being able to use my education in neuroscience and nutrition (and just general empathy and relatable experience) to help people who are struggling has been absolutely invaluable. I really hope anyone reading this considers two things: 1. It does get better, please please please hang in there. 2. By giving your time and empathy to others who are in need, you might improve your own trauma and well being in addition to theirs. I truly believe this can apply to anyone and everyone. Good luck to all, much love!"
180,2,"Tw for SA.

Literally had a mental breakdown just from seeing his profile pic on my DMs. 

For context: i was 15-16 when I got into a relationship with a guy my age. I didn't know I could get ptsd from a teenage relationship but looking back, it was way worse than what I remembered. We were very toxic, broke up and came back together like 7 times. He started off by isolating me from my friends, he was very controlling. He always said he would change. He made sexual advances, and I didn't complain but didn't say yes either. He would insist on having sex, and he would act sad if I said no. This went on for almost a year until I couldn't take it anymore. After breaking up, he stalked me for months, i couldn't walk around without feeling scared. 

Before all of this, I was SAed when I was younger, this guy told me it was all my fault, that I wanted it, etc. And when I told him to stop insisting when I said no to sex, he would say he'd change, he never changed. I have been struggling to even accept it was rape, there is more to this that I don't remember either.

I was diagnosed with PTSD some months ago, a bit after I turned 18. And my ex just texted me. I had him blocked, he probably made another account. He asked for forgiveness, saying he now realizes he had been bad towards me and hopes everything is going well in my life. 

I don't want to forgive him. I hate him so much, and i hate how this still affects my daily life, even after two years."
181,3,"Hello everyone,

I'm (33m) looking for advice to help my partner (34f). She has probable AuDHD, POTS and CPTSD which leaves finding information on these a bit tricky.

90% of the time we are great, but every once in a while we will have a huge argument. This normally involves her listing off how I am similar to her ex and that I don't support her emotionally. 

Trying to talk it out as I apologise and try to explain only leads up down the arguement route. Normally ending up her refusing to sleep in our bed, planning our break up or making plans without me. 

Normally we are ok by the end of next day. I stay up late and ask her to come bed eventually we will and we sleep for a couple of hours, wake up and start our day awkwardly. 

While I take my fair share of the blame as I normally trigger her when she is already on the brink of a meltdown. E.g I have ADHD so my constant dopamine searches can be seen as dismissal or ignoring our friends. 

I try and massage her daily and I do all the chores, although when I'm tired this sometimes also triggers her slightly. I read a lot about autism and pots and try and help with this.

She has in the past said that I have to just ride the storm out as she knows what she says is hurtful.

When I try and explain myself using 'I' focuses, this triggers her CPTSD, if I give her space to cooldown, triggers CPTSD.

I love her oh so very much, and I hate triggering her but any additional advice to assist so I can either smoothly resolve the argument or anything I haven't considered regarding triggering her would be greatly appreciated.

If you have any questions, I will try and answer them asap :)

182,0,"It’s not really a victory so to speak but I’m taking it as one. I was in an abusive situation that was in a professional setting. It was so bad I developed ptsd from it and am not the only one of my peers to have it. It’s only been within the last year I’ve felt like I’ve turned a corner for the most part. 

Anyways, one thing that usually triggers me is I occasionally get emails from this place. I’ve tried a bunch of different ways to stop getting emails from them but some still manage to get through. Most of the time it has given me a panic attack when I’ve gotten one. I’ve even thrown my phone across the room before when I’ve had one pop up unexpectedly. I’ve been working on it and now I just usually had over my phone to my husband and he blocks and deletes all trace of them. 

Today I got an email from them but I am so giddy about it. It was announcing that one of the two people who were abusing us is retiring. I’m so happy this person is leaving and will no longer be in a position of power to abuse people like they did. This also means the second person may follow them soon as the person retiring was their protector. I gleefully blocked and deleted the email. 

I’m taking it as a win because I didn’t have a panic attack and a truly terrible person will no longer be abusing people in this place. I will admit that I am very tempted to mail a retirement “gift” to them in the form of a company who will mail people boxes of animal poo. 

I’m just proud of all of the work I did to help myself recover enough that I can take joy in knowing that this particular evil person’s reign is coming to an end. Ding dong the witch is dead (ok, just retired but the sentiment is the same). "

I'm taking anti depression meds but they don't help me. I have no support in my life. I keep having flashbacks to that event and having lots of thoughts of suicide that don't go away. There is nothing happy or fun in my life even though I tried to find something."
185,3,"How do you function in day to day with PTSD? I have been dealing with it for almost a year and a half and I usually don't get through the day without getting triggered and reliving. My experience was physical and left me without a body part I used to have. It feels like I literally cannot escape it because I can't escape my body. I was not conscious for the event, but the person who did that to me is just so evil that I cannot fathom it. The combination of being sexually violated with this physical aspect is just killing me. Counseling has not helped at all. I have no idea what to do. I don't understand how I am supposed to hold a job and be functional living in this state. How do you cope when conventional methods of making art/therapy/going outside do not work?"

My therapist has recently put a referral in for trauma therapy. I think it’s a good idea, but ever since our meeting ended I have been anxious about it. I reached out to a friend telling them I didn’t really think I was traumatised enough for it, to which they responded that I definitely was and probably the most functional “mental” person they know (they are also mentally ill, so it’s not said without humor and empathy). I’ve been anxious since, flashing back to the things that I’ll be talking about in therapy. Do you have any advice about easing into therapy, especially if I’m reacting so poorly just to the idea? I fear I’ll start therapy, then come home to my house where I live alone and self harm. "

188,1,"Long time sub-reddit follower, first time poster

So i have been hesitating to watch this movie bc A24 can make a wild movie. A few days ago I saw that scene with that song. Posted the song and a bud reached out. We talked and he told me he walked out of the movie crying. Idunno shared experiences ya know. But it hit me in one of those very rare ways. Had me chucking laughing and crying at the same time from that opening scene. 

Im going thru a ugly divorce and have been mostly alone and dealing. Lost alot. I see how much a distraction family and the kids were. Other times when I've been secretly overwhelmed I had those things. The kids, my cat, a woman, other things. Now I've lost nearly everything and everyone that has ment something. But I overcame the moment. Took awhile but I didn't drink or any other negative coping methods. I'm going to to discuss it with ny counselor later this week.

Idunno I'm sure others have felt the same. Still best job I ever had. Cheers to us."

My default is to try to be present and show love and care but I had not realised this was achieving the opposite effect and I broke contact multiple times which sadly I think delayed their healing. They have recently come out of a long term relationship and had experience of being stalked. Does anyone have experience with this or have CPTSD themselves? As you can see, I don't have much at all! Thank you!"
190,1,"Before my last breakup (after just 6 months of relationship) I had clearer intents and mid-term plans, I felt like some things were defining who I was (like my passions, in a good way), I felt I was someone.

During and after my breakup I went through a progressive loss of identity, were I slowly lost all, everything I was, everything who was making me **me.**

I'm wondering if this is something related to PTSD and dissociation.

I don't think it's even a case if, after the breakup I: left my therapist for a new one, had a crisis with work that is leading me into changing or also possibly get fired, completely flattened all ideas I had about my future, all my passions not tailored to ""just surviving"".

This is something that happens to me: I periodically go through this crisis were I simply go back to zero. Back to the starting point.

Now I have to figure it all out again: what I want to do for a living, OH WAIT do I even wanna live? Do I want to be with someone in an intimate way ever again? Do I want to just roam around? Workaways? Vanlife? Working holidays? It's like adolescence is never ending and it starts from zero every single time.

I already struggle with suicidal ideation and I feel I need a real change, and it's hard to deal with all that on its own, but as soon as I'm looking out for opportunities, I see how everything out there is just completely fragmented and unreachable.. Each one of the working/living opportunities feels like a huge work and not even worth it, it feels like I can only see the cons in things, and I cannot really see a point into striving anymore..

I feel that whatever I will do I will find myself wrapped in this huge pain and these triggered periods of time in which I just feel stuck and somehow lose myself and every sense of purpose, hope or even fun.

I think first thing first is I should have a reason for living, which I'm not sure I have.

How would you want to live if you cannot feel? And when you **do** feel it's such a huge mess?

I mean yesterday evening I was googling painless suicide methods and today I want to feel like I own my way of living.. I know it's way more complicated that this. And that's why I'm discouraged, I cannot do much more than this, I won't be able to for the next several months.. Until I veeeeery slowly start to trust myself and others back again.

I know reality requires energy, real work, purpose, being with your feet on the ground.

I feel like I'm doomed in periodically losing everything I have. And is there a more precise definition of dissociation?

Last time during my peaks I was thinking I was dying, not in a paranoid hypochondriac way, I was literally feeling myself going away."
191,1,"I came on here some months ago and asked if I could have trauma from not directly experiencing something and you all said that yes I indeed can. Just some background info, my mom was shot and killed by her boyfriend in 2023. Since then I have started a family and pretty much have done my best to move on and lead a happy life. Postpartum gets me sometimes but I’m working on that. Anyways, I think about my mom and her situation on a daily basis, I miss my mom and I just feel like I can’t rest bc they never caught her murderer. I had the weirdest dream last night. I was visiting my mom and she was living in squalor and had rotting food in her fridge. I was mortified and asked her to just come live with me and my baby. She was so happy and I started cleaning around her apartment and we made plans to grocery shop. Before my mom died she lived in an apartment on the same property as our other family. I was doing things and just talking about my job, but when I turned around to look at her she looked weird like uncanny valley. I just went to her door outside and started crying and yelling for help I don’t know what necessarily made me do that in my dream but my cousins came by to me out their house in front of my moms and they were asking me what I was doing in an empty apartment and I was telling them I have to move my mom out and I questioned why they were letting her live like that? And they looked at me and they were just like “Shes dead.” And they begged me to go home and I was walking around the city just crying and panicking bc I couldn’t find my man or my baby. Idk when grief gets easier or when things start to feel better. I know she’s dead, my man says I’m not letting her rest but I don’t understand how you can just not when she died a horrific way and I tortured myself bc I somehow got the ring camera footage of it. I saw it all go down. I just wasn’t there. It was sent to me after the fact. Grief is not linear "
192,2,"hi guys can u report this acc pls, he blackmail me and doing revenge porn ‪https://www.instagram.com/damarariki26?igsh=dWZlYm5qMWo0OXRl "
193,2,"I don’t know what to expect. I’m pretty confident I know the outcome but I don’t know how a PTSD diagnosis will make me feel. For those who have been here:

Did you find out that day?
What was the eval like? Were you triggered? 
How much detail did they ask you to go into about your trauma? 
How did a diagnosis make you feel? 
What did you do after? I have to go back to work but I’m concerned I’ll be too upset. "
194,2,"Hey, I (17nb) have gotten to therapy due to, well, overwhelm paired with sensory overload I guess. But, very quickly despite me shielding from it for quite some time now, the topic of my traumas came up. And I told her all about my initial trauma, and it's connected to my parents. Since I'm not yet 18, she's going to talk to them about it. She told me that it's to make them understand some mistakes (as she came to the conclusion that I was a bit alone for all my childhood and that no parent should look for support in their child like that...). I'm scared that scratching this wound may make them fight again or divorce - furthermore that their actions might have resulted in my health problems. I don't want them to begin blaming each other or feel guilty. I am trying to keep rational but my body just freezes whenever this topic comes up and I feel like my heart is going to jump out of my chest.


I guess what I seek is some words of reassurance, please."
195,1,"I’ve never talked about this before. Only very vaguely with my therapist. I have a PTSD diagnosis for other situations but I’ve never told her about this one. 1. because it’s embarrassing 2. because it involves someone still in my life 3. because thinking about it makes it so much worse so why would I talk about it and 4. because I can’t accept that it was a trauma. 

I obviously won’t get into details but I experienced CSA at the hands of my sister. It happened multiple times when I was young. I think between the ages of like 8-11? 9-12? something like that I don’t really remember the age that well. But the thing is I can’t accept that this happened let alone accept that it’s a trauma and is effecting me. It didn’t happen in the way that these events “stereotypically happen”. The big way that you see in news stories or tv shows. It was small and subtle and I didn’t know what it was when it was happening. So I can’t accept that it’s real and that it’s affecting me. But it is affecting me. 

For the first time in my life I’m in a safe, loving relationship with the girl of my dreams. She’s perfect in every way imaginable like she was torn out of the pages of a cheesy romance novel. She’s perfect and yet I can’t be intimate with her. We’ve been together 6 months now and I can’t do it. I know she’s a safe person I know she would never hurt me like that but every time she puts her hands on me like that I have to stop. And of course she’s amazing about it because she’s perfect but it’s just killing me. I’m 23 now and something that happened over 10 years ago is still getting in the way of my life. 

I told her about it, again, vaguely because I’ve never told anyone who it was or the exact details of what happened, and she has been nothing but supportive with me and patient with me and it makes me want to scream and cry because I can’t get over this stupid fucking period of my life. And we’ve been trying to work on it very slowly and I just keep freaking out and she responds perfectly and I just feel like shit. I feel like shit because I can’t be with my girlfriend. I feel like shit because something that’s supposed to be so good and so natural is ruined for me. 

I don’t know what to do. I feel sick all the time. And I know I could talk to my therapist but they say you shouldn’t start processing trauma when you’re still around it. I live in the house it happened in. I shower in that bathroom everyday. My sister lives here too. It wouldn’t be a good idea to start now. So I just don’t know anymore. I feel so stuck. I feel so stupid and helpless and I just hate everything. And I don’t know what to do. "
196,2,Does anyone else have to go by a different first name to avoid their PTSD? I'm not going to go too much into my circumstances with this but during and after my traumatic event (developmental trauma/child abuse) I've had to go by a different name. Hearing my legal name makes me freak out have a really bad episode/flashbacks. All of my therapists have agreed that my reaction when I hear it is ptsd related. I've never heard of anyone like this. I can't really control my reaction to it so there's no choice other than going by another name.
197,1,"TW: my dad got murdered a few months ago i seen the crime scene and his decomposing body a month later and i have got told by the doctors i have ptsd, i find it very hard to sleep at night im normally up till about 6am, my mum had to sleep in beside me for 6 months (im 16) its been 8 months now and everytime i do manage to fall asleep i have really bad dreams, for example everytime i have a dream it’s ALWAYS bad, like my friends/other family members being killed the way my dad did but dying right infront of me and me not being able to save them, or my dream will be a full recreation of what actually happened the night my dad died (we don’t know what happened still but i have a good idea on what did) ive never actually been killed in my dream its always family or friends dying infront of me and me not being able to save them, and when they do die they either stare up at me (my dad eyes were terrifying when i seen his body a month later) or the blood when they die in my dreams is the exact same as the blood i seen in my dads flat? im not sure if this will be linked "
198,0,"It’s kind of wild how people who have not had PTSD can be ignorant and insensitive, sometimes even dangerously so. 

It’s apparently PTSD awareness month. I’m considering doing some social media posts for my network and I want to work on assembling a set of short well-sourced pieces of writing that try to get the most important things that we as people living with PTSD need the public—and the people in our lives—to know. 

There are a bunch of things that I wish people could understand, and that I wish I had learned sooner in this non-linear journey. For example: Trauma ≠ PTSD. How to decrease nightmares. Common misconceptions. 

I wonder what everyone here wishes people would know about PTSD, or what you wish you had known sooner, or what you’re trying to figure out now. 

If you could snap your fingers and have people understand something about it, or act/not act in a certain way, what would you focus on? What would have the biggest impact in your life? "
199,1,"It’s really daunting to keep accepting that life with ptsd is just something i (30f) will live with forever. It’s hard enough trying to get through every day and stay afloat, that I find myself very envious of other people who know not of the depths of despair. Those who live life with the curiosity and wonder to move about the world with freedom and liberty, while I feel plagued with hopelessness and fractured sense of self. I have to think of the horrible things I’ve been through nearly every day. Others can barely stomach a short story sharing of my past while I have no choice but to think about it and experience it. Even in my subconscious, I am riddled with the residue of tragedy. 

I wish I could have a life free of these fears and sad emotions all the time. I want to live life without knowing how badly I could be hurt. But It’s all I think about now. "
200,1,"I’ve been living with death anxiety.
After getting diagnosed, I was told I have death-related OCD, anxiety, chronic stress, and PTSD.
It’s been a full year in this pit this heavy, sinking place that keeps pulling me deeper every time I try to get out.
I can’t live like others do.

A year has passed and I’ve forgotten what true joy feels like.
I’ve forgotten how it feels to laugh without forcing it.
Even sleep something that should bring peace has turned into a form of escape… or a source of fear.
I dream terrifying things almost every night.
And every time something good happens, a voice inside me whispers no, echoes deep inside:
“This won’t last. Something bad is coming.”
It’s like any moment of happiness is just a setup for the next tragedy.

For a whole year now, I eat because I’m hungry, not because I enjoy food.
I can’t remember the last time I worked out or even moved my body freely.
Most days, I just curl up in the corner of my room, frozen by this thought:
“Something’s not right… something bad is coming.”

I see death in everything.
Every little thing around me feels like a sign… a warning… the beginning of the end.
It’s like I’m stuck in a war zone bullets flying, bombs going off and I’m hiding under the rubble, waiting.
Waiting for it to end.
But I don’t know when.
So I’m just stuck in this constant state of fear and alertness.

I’ve started biting my nails.
Pulling at my hair.
The dark circles under my eyes are proof that I don’t sleep 
because I wait for morning, just to make sure everything and everyone is still okay.

All of this started with two nightmares both about death, filled with terrifying symbols.
And ever since then, I don’t even recognize who I’ve become.
"
201,1,"It's been around 2 months since I attempted. I swallowed around 68 lamotragine tablets and some painkillers. Regretted it and my parents rushed me to the hospital. I think I would have caused permanent damaged if we didn't go so quick.

I don't remember much from the first night. All I remember was being fed a shit ton of coal, throwing up every 5 minutes and passing out after a while. 

Thing is, my mother told me that I woke up around an hour later and they walked to another ward. She told me I was speaking to them and everything. What scares me is that I don't remember anything after passing out. I also apparently woke up several times throughout the night too. All I remember after is waking up in a different bed the next morning. Could barely walk and I was slurring my words.

Two months later, the three nights I spent in the hospital still haunt me. I get constant visual and auditory flashbacks and I find it very difficult to take my meds because I need to take the same ones I overdosed on. It's making me miserable.

I've heard that some kind of memory loss and auditory/visual flashbacks related to traumatic events may be signs of PTSD. I know that most people in this sub aren't doctors but I need someone's opinion. Thanks."
202,2,"hi i'm 21 and i've struggled with cptsd for the majority of my life. I still live with my mother who is mostly the cause of it. She's had me cut off from the outside world for most my life and i'm finally starting to get out in the real world, going to college and such.

It's nice, I have some legit friends now and they seem to genuinely like me. But I still struggle of course, the kind of trauma i've been through doesn't just go away as i'm sure you all know. 

I have off days, and sometimes I get triggered dissociate and start acting weird. I'm sure they notice. I can't offer a true explanation because that's just trauma dumping and people get uncomfortable. 

Sometimes I think maybe I should tell some of them instead of just being all ominous and weird about it. You know like sometimes I just have to step back and be like uh I gotta go when I start getting to anxious or paranoid and jumpy.

But at the same time I feel like it could be a TERRIBLE idea to tell them! 

The reason i'm asking right now is because I feel i'm going to have a rough couple weeks coming up. And I don't know how to explain why i'm acting this way, what do I do?"
203,1,I only talked about a small part of my upbringing and stopped because who I was talking to was starting to tear up and she straight up said she wanted to cry for me. It feels bittersweet when someone offers sympathy that often our blood relatives never give us. 
204,3,"I’ve been trying to put all of this into words for a long time. I don’t even think this post will cover everything, but it’s the closest I’ve gotten to explaining what I’ve been living with.

I’ve recently been diagnosed with adjustment disorder, and I’m doing EMDR therapy now. It’s helping in small ways but, it’s also stirred up so much that I feel like I’m unraveling just trying to get through normal life.

I’m constantly hyperventilating or on edge. When I’m on edge I smoke. I feel like I’m in survival mode 24/7. My nervous system is wired like the fire alarm is always going off even when I’m sitting in silence. I get chest tightness, panic, and feel emotionally numb all at the same time.

I know I’m not okay, but have no idea whats going on. On top of that I’m still trying to go to school, function at work, and maintain relationships. And that’s part of the problem—because on the outside I look “fine,” but internally I feel like I’m slowly falling apart.

In high school, I’m pretty sure I had flashbacks—moments where I’d suddenly dissociate, panic, feel like I wasn’t even in my body. At the time I didn’t know what they were. I just thought I was crazy. Now, I don’t have flashbacks anymore… but I feel nothing instead. It’s like the trauma didn’t leave—it just shut off access to my emotions.

I’ve dealt with a lot of toxic people. I had a narcissistic best friend who completely twisted my sense of worth. I was in a codependent relationship with an ex where I abandoned myself just to keep the peace. And my home life was never calm—I was constantly walking on eggshells, always alert, always in fight-or-flight. I never felt safe enough to just exist.

Now? I don’t know how to “just be.”

I overanalyze everything. I go into “detective mode” constantly—trying to understand people’s motives, tone, dynamics, energy shifts. I stay up late dissecting conversations from weeks ago. It’s not because I want drama. It’s because I’m trying to predict danger before it hits me.

My therapist asked, “Why do you feel like you need to understand everything?” and I couldn’t answer. But deep down, I know: it’s not about clarity—it’s about safety and predictably.

The worst part is how this is affecting my relationship with my partner. I love them, but I feel emotionally numb most of the time. I want to connect. I choose them every day. But my body shuts down before I can catch up emotionally. When they try to get close, I freeze. I can’t explain it. I just feel like there’s a wall between me and them, and I didn’t even build it on purpose.

I hate that I’m like this. I want to feel present. I want to give them everything they deserve. But I don’t even know what’s going on inside me half the time.

In school, I feel isolated. I’ve questioned some group-think dynamics in my department and was basically socially exiled for it. Now I feel like I’m learning in isolation and always being watched or judged.

I dissociate. I shut down. I mask my emotions so I don’t scare people off. But inside, I feel like I’m either drowning or floating above my life. Never grounded. Never okay.

And honestly… I feel like I don’t even know how to talk to people anymore. Like I forgot how to have normal interactions. I want connection, but it’s like something in me doesn’t know how to exist around others without reading for threats.

Because if you’ve had to decode moods to avoid being hurt, if you’ve been punished for being honest or vulnerable, if your whole nervous system was built to survive—not to connect—then trying to be a person again feels impossible.

EMDR is helping me open things up, but it hasn’t brought relief yet. It just feels like I’m now aware of how bad things really are—and that hurts.

I guess I’m just tired. Not hopeless. Just exhausted from carrying all this.

If anyone’s been here—if you’ve dealt with anything like this or could share some advice/guidance/literally anything to help me understand what i’m dealing with. I’d would really appreciate hearing how you’ve navigated this. Or even just hearing “same” would help.

Thank you for reading. I’m just trying to survive while healing, and I don’t want to feel so alone in it anymore."
205,3,"Everytime I try to do actual trauma work I get scared or something else stressful is happening and i cant focus on anything other than that (like for example my roommate has been really aggressive towards me recently and will be getting kicked out soon hopefully) or my brain goes into a mode where I can't think and I'm just having flashbacks and I physically can't speak about what happened. Another thing that keeps happening when I try to speak about it is my body starts shivering, which is a stress reaction but it can feel really uncomfortable you just want your body to stop moving so much and to stop displaying symptoms of someone who is afraid. "
206,2,I left my DV situation about a month or two now. I have been having the worst time sleeping lately. I can get to sleep just fine but legit 2-4 hrs later I'm up and can not go back to sleep for the life of me. Then I have to function the rest of the day in a fog. I am going to go to therapy but can't until I move later this month. Can any body give me advice on how I can possibly get some sleep if you ever went through this. I feel like I'm breaking down more and more every day. I just want to sleep but my brain will wake me up thinking I'm in danger. I'm so tired. 
207,2,Anyone that has developed a stutter or impaired speech associated with their PTSD - what have you done to help it?
208,2,"Hey,

I was wondering if anyone else can't put both earbuds at the same time ? It stresses me out when I can't hear myself breathing (I feel like i'm too loud or also can't breathe correctly). Also it stresses me out to not be aware of my surroundings. It's mostly outside, inside when i'm home alone It's ok.

I was diagnosed with cptsd from childhood to adulthood bc of a dysfunctional family, is it because of this ? I never heard anyone having this issue.

(sry i'm not english)

Thanks"
209,2,"for a long time now, ive wanted to send a letter to my step father about all the things he put me through. He is still married to my mother and the both of them still seem happy together, even though they both know what i was put through. Contemplating writing this letter has been really hard because 1) I know I only want this letter to get him to understand and to hopefully feel bad for what he did to me.

2) Im scared it will not help me in the long run because he will either reply saying sorry or nothing at all. Or he will just ignore it. I dont think any of those options would help me in anyway. 

  
has anyone written a letter to their abuser (especially a parent) and felt good about it? did it help you move on?"
210,1,"

I am trying to heal myself and wondering if there are any books worth reading that aren’t too triggering for someone looking to overcome trauma from childhood SA and be able to move on and become more normal again? 

Also, if there is anything else that helped you to move on and heal please feel free to mention in the comments below, I am just not keen on seeing a therapist due to my past experiences with counselling (for other issues). 

Thanks in advance "
211,2,"Today i just found out that one of ptsd symptoms was constant forgetting, the brain works and thinks too much to the point that it makes people forget a lot and especially on the short-term memory, like forgetting what you are told from the second you were told something immediately and other examples, but it’s also related to ptsd, is it true? And does it have anything to do with adhd or what? "
212,3,"I m so tired and overwhelmed. Everyone did me wrong. I never deserved it. What wrong have I done

I went through the most traumatic incident in my life and nobody once comforted me through it. My mother called me a whore. She blamed me for everything. The cousins I thought were close to me were actually not that close? I was so stupid. I thought they cared. But they got tired of me and told me everything that happened was a consequence of my own actions. That if I never dated that guy, none of it would have ever happened. Why did nobody once comfort me knowing that I was 16 and he was in his 20s? Why did nobody tell me I was being groomed and why did no one worry about me when my life was crumbling down? Instead, my older cousin called me obnoxious and self centered. I had no idea what I did. Maybe I made a mistake, but she could have been kinder. My mother cousin just cut me off for no reason, we never even talked after that incident when she told me to shut up abt it because she was tired of hearing me talk about the same thing again and again.
My relationships have all fallen apart since that day. Idk how long I can withhold it."
213,1,"I had my first in person therapy session today. It’s taken 3 years but I’ve finally accepted I desperately needed help and that the man I describe below was something called a covert narcissist. I always would’ve said I was too clever and together to see anything like this happen to me, nor would I ever have said that a relationship could cause ‘trauma’. I feel dramatic even just saying all this. How wrong I was and for everyone out there going through this. Big hug. 

I was involved with a man for about a year. He was 31 I was 27. We had a close, emotionally intense relationship, we spoke constantly and he pursued me actively. Until he very suddenly turned on me. He’d give me enough to keep me around but would never truly let me go. I ended it after my mental health took a real turn but he still kept trying to come back. I know much better now and have learnt a lot of lessons but I was younger and we would intermittently meet where he gave me the impression he would sort out his mental health and we could try again. I later found out in the most sickening way (a mutual friends instagram) that I wasn’t the only one. He was in a serious, long-term relationship with another woman who happened to be his ex. So whilst he was trying to ‘fix and sort things’ with me, sleeping together etc after we split; the entire time he’d gotten back together with her.  She lived overseas and they’d been together for 10+ years yet never closed the gap. The year we were together was when they broke up during Covid. 

I confronted him. The first thing he said was ‘we need to stop speaking because we’re toxic for each other’ I was devastated. But instead of disappearing, I made what I thought was the right choice and I told her - because I’d want someone to do the same for me

I sent her a really thoughtful message explaining everything. I told her I had proof: messages, timelines, voice notes etc and she refused to see it. She didn’t want the evidence.  We eventually spoke on the phone and the magnitude of his lies was disgusting - to both me and her. She didn’t lash out at me, but she didn’t acknowledge any of it either. I later found out she stayed.

Fast forward to now, almost two years later — I recently found out she has moved to my country to be with him. She left her whole life behind friends, career, support system to relocate for a man who lied to and cheated on her. They’re now publicly posting happy photos together, and it’s hit me like a truck. I can’t stop shaking. I feel like I’ve been used, erased, and discarded, while they get to ride off into the sunset. All over again. 

I know I didn’t “lose.” I know, logically, that I dodged a bullet. But the injustice of it all is crushing me. I tried to do the right thing and it feels like I’m the only one who paid the price.
I want to feel unbothered. I want to move on. But I can’t seem to reconcile the fact that they get to look happy after everything he did — and that she willingly walked into it with open eyes.

Do people like this ever actually end up happy long term? I know it doesn’t matter and I need to move on with my life (which I know will happen in time) I’m terrified I will always feel this way but I feel like therapy was absolutely the right first step in putting this ugly situation to bed. 

Thanks in advance for reading this far. I just needed to let it out.
"
214,2,"Hi Reddit users,

I’m writing this in the hopes that someone out there might relate to what I’m going through—or at the very least, help me feel less alone.

Everything started spiraling after a traumatic experience involving my brother. One day, I witnessed him faint and have what appeared to be a seizure. Medically, it could be called a seizure, but in our Asian household, my mom believed it was a form of spiritual possession. And honestly… I felt the same. It didn’t look like a “normal” seizure. His body moved strangely, and he was mumbling spiritual phrases—begging something to “get away from me.”

At first, I tried to brush it off. My brother was rushed to the hospital and admitted for blood work. The results turned out fine and nothing appeared to be wrong - which was honestly quite strange considering if he had a seizure. My mom and I returned home anyway after that. But from that night onward, I couldn’t sleep.

I didn’t think much of it initially, but one sleepless night turned into two, then three… and before I realized it, I had gone an entire month without proper sleep. I was constantly awake—my eyes would close, but I could never rest. If I did doze off, it would be for 30 minutes, maybe an hour at most—and every single time, I would dream.

This has been my life for the past **nine months** now.

I haven’t had a full night’s rest in all this time. I never sleep for more than an hour, and even then, my mind is active in dreams. I feel like I haven’t truly *rested* in nearly a year.

Worse still, I’ve become afraid of everything—things I was never scared of before. Loud noises. A sudden knock on the door. Even the world outside. I haven’t left the house in months—not because I’m physically unable to, but because I’m *afraid*. Of what exactly? I don’t even know anymore. I’m just scared.

In the midst of all this, I also went through a painful breakup from a long-term relationship of six years. On top of that, I’ve been actively job-seeking, but have been facing constant rejections. I'm not sure if all of this—the heartbreak, the career uncertainty, the trauma with my brother—has compounded into the state I’m in now. But it feels like everything hit me at once, and I’ve been unraveling ever since.

I’ve tried everything: psychologists, psychiatrists, therapy, EMDR, traditional Chinese medicine, the iMRS PEMF system… we even invited monks to cleanse the house and perform prayers for me. But nothing has helped. I still can’t sleep.

It’s such an odd, painful feeling—because I’m still me. I know I am. But at the same time, I’m not. Something is missing. It’s as if my soul has been taken away from me. I feel like i’ve spiralled into a dark depressive state of mind on top of all the post trauma.  

Every day is a struggle and torture. I’ve honestly thought of ending the pain and just leave.

215,1,"I really want to get back into art as a coping mechanism, but I always feel like I can never properly express myself emotionally because I never got to have a real childhood/adolescense to explore who I am while I was trapped in survival mode...

I can never think of anything to draw, my anatomy is awful and my mind always panics and goes blank at a million miles an hour. I feel so defeated and exhausted every day like I'll never be good at anything...even video games are a struggle.

I've heard really good things about the book ""The Artist's Way"" by Julia Cameron, and was curious if anyone else has tried her journaling method to erase their trauma induced art block/perfectionism etc.?

What would be a good way for an aspiring amateur like me to get into art as a way to fully process my trauma and get rid of that mental disconnect between me and my past that my brain tries to protect me from? (If that makes sense)

Also, what is your favorite art medium for healthy coping?  I like pottery and Kintsugi but I'd like to get into painting on canvas. How would you say art helps you heal?

EDIT: I'm finding coloring helpful for keeping me focused and present, so maybe I'll start small there for right now.

EDIT 2: I ordered both Artist's Way and Big Magic which will be here tomorrow. Thank you to everyone for all your help!! Excited to finally start my healing journey and hopefully get my inner artist back. ❤️‍🩹✌️"
216,2,"I haven't been on sertraline long, I got it prescribed after I started getting PTSD coming out all of a sudden from a bad work accident I had 2 years ago that nearly killed me. I've been taking sertraline 4 weeks now. I was really hesitant on taking antidepressants but figured SSRIs weren't too bad and my doctor assured me they're different from the old antidepressants and easy to come off anytime. I was really bad when I first started taking them, not able to go to work, barely able to leave the house I was so riddled with anxiety, but still had it in my head that I would just take them long just to get past it and be able to start leaving the house again and get back to work then go off them.

I'm at 4 weeks now and I don't know if I just naturally pushed myself to get past it and leave the house and get back to work or if it was the sertraline that helped me do it, I'm sure it helped a bit at least. I feel better now than when the PTSD first hit. I'm 30 and have basically had depression and anxiety my whole life, first time I can remember it being really bad was when I was 10, I'm sure it was there before then, thats just when my first really vivid memory of it. I don't really feel much better than when I had my normal depression/anxiety, a bit better but not enough that it feels worth being on tablets.

I just really don't know what to do. I don't know if the PTSD will come back if I stop taking them but also if they were to help cure the depression I've always had then I think they'd be worth taking, the idea or life without depression/anxiety sounds great. I really don't want to be on tablets forever tho if it's something I can just put up with. I also read a lot of sertraline and other SSRI withdrawl posts here and what my doctor said about them being easy to come off sounds like a load of shite, so I don't want to get deep into it and then want to come off after 2 years or something and have to go through hell to come off them and be where I don't know if I'm having withdrawals from it or if it's bad depression or just how I would feel without it.

Could really just use some advice on if people think it's something I should stay on or if I should at least try going off it. Also I've only been on it 4 weeks at 50mg/day so if I go off now I assume it won't be that hard of withdrawals if any or what should I expect?

Edit: also my first week I got bad side effects, really bad headaches, hot flashes and just feeling sick but it went away fully after the first week so that makes me worry it'll come back as withdrawals if I go off it"
217,2,"He doesn't remember them all, but I can almost always tell when he's having one. He makes these awful, fearful noises in his sleep and it guts me every time, makes me want to cry for him. These nightmares almost always wake him up in a sweat, and keep him awake for hours. I wake him up if I hear them and hold him/rub his back until he goes back to sleep, but is there any other way to prevent them? He loses a ton of sleep over this. Any advice is appreciated, thank you."
218,2,"So I’m someone who’s working on getting my childhood issues resolved and well I met someone who’s going to do EMDR Therapy with me. She told me that from our first visit she gathered that I have symptoms of PTSD which I was surprised to hear because I was mostly diagnosed with ADHD, Autism, and Anxiety Disorder with a moment of Bipolar (which I don’t believe I have). I am not disregarding my diagnosis’s but I’m just processing all this and was told to keep to myself when I need an outlet since I really want to feel less alone and work on my issues that are stopping me from my full potential. Any support or advice will do! "
219,2,"I'm pretty sure I have PTSD but I'm not diagnosed, I went to therapy for a few years after coming out of my traumatic situation but they didn't tell me anything about it and it's really something I need to deal with, I've been having a very bad time for 2 years since I escaped and I think it's getting worse. In a few days I will go to a check-up with my psychiatrist to check my medication, should I tell him? I'm afraid of being made fun of"
220,0,"I just got a new prescription for duloxetine and I'm getting off of using SSRI's and this new thing to me is now an SNRI and I can already kind of feel a mood change. I still find it weird that the VA was trying different prescriptions on me such as Prozac and Zoloft, and because I've been experiencing some form of nerve pain of my left leg I was newly prescribed this. It feels a lot better and I don't feel as zombified as I did while on SSRI's. Just a little vent, especially to anyone who is also going through PTSD. I'm really liking this a lot lately. "
221,2,"I have PTSD from a dv relationship with my ex, and also having my car vandalised from past friendship. I have bad anxiety and also OCD (a few subtypes). I left my relationship with my ex 2 months ago now. Ever since then I have only rarely left my house, only to go to the gym, get groceries etc. I wfh as well. I used to be a lot more social, organise things with friends etc. But now I stay at home and I am quite solitary. I can’t really trust people and when I try to, I get bad intrusive thoughts and my heart starts racing. I also have really really bad trauma from my ex. But I feel ashamed for staying home all the time, I’m only 24 and I feel like there’s something wrong with me that I just like to stay by myself. How long will I be like this for? Does anyone else do this? "
222,0,"Firstly,  I can never think of a good title. So I apologise.

Secondly, I was diagnosed at 52(f) late last year with cPTSD.

I sat on the info, only sharing with my partner (53m) and my adult kids, for a while, cause I needed to process, and wondered what this means for me going forward. I am in therapy, with a fabulous therapist.

I've been letting close friends know, and majority are like ok. Asked a few questions. Offered a hug (I'm a hugger) or just went ok.

One friend who I've known about 15 years, said oh that makes sense.

Kinda stumped me. What makes sense?

I'm still me. Anyone else have something similar happen?  No. I didn't ask said friend, as I don't like confrontation  and wasn't sure I wanted to hear at the time why she thought it mad sense.

how did you feel about it if so?

Also hoping this sub is alot nicer than the others telling you to divorce and marry the toaster 🤣"
223,2,"No matter who you are friend, romantic partner or family I will never truly or fully trust you. It’s crazy to me non traumatized people do that, that you can just be friends with someone or date someone and have full trust in them and not constantly question their intentions or constantly look out for signs that the person is mad at them or that their going to hurt them. It’s like my mind goes “This is a human being that’s capable of anything and has the full capacity to hurt you how the hell do you fully trust them?” "
224,2,"My PTSD has metastasized into severe panic attacks and phobias. I'm conquering it by intentionally inducing these reactions in a controlled manner. My anxiety tolerance is increasing, as is my self-efficacy. I can now navigate and overcome panic. Though conquering my fear is still a ways off.

It's taken a really long time. I've been at it a year or more. I kinda laugh when WebMD tells me exposure therapy lasts 8 sessions. Try 800! LOL. 

The hyperarousal aspect of PTSD on top of a pre-existing anxiety disorder really did a number on me. But progress has been made and is being made. I'm training my brain to react differently to fear. It's a tall order. For sure. But I have to keep pushing forward. Thanks for reading."
225,2,"Hi, I’ve been seeing a clinical psychologist for a while. Currently, we haven’t had much sessions to fully unpack my trauma but I am increasingly interested in receiving a diagnosis in a similar vein to PTSD or CPTSD. I’ve received a fair share of medical invalidation from professionals so I’m a bit hesitant.

I was wondering how this experience went for people who were diagnosed with either one of these disorders? And what to specifically discuss in regards to it? "
226,3,"hii i turned 16 yesterday, when i was 7 i was diagnosed with ptsd by my psychiatrist as my father would starve, and beat me. Eventually he attempted to beat me to death in public where i just passed out , causing him to think he succeeded. I was traumatized and vulnerable, people took advantage of that and i was r4ped and molested a few months- and a year later (all by different people) 
because of this since the age of 7 i have been having ptsd nightmares where i am beat- after i was touched they evolved to me being beat and touched over and over and over again. i slept with my mom until i was around 9 i believe, but i was still having nightmares. I’ve been to ward countless times, first time being at age 8 as i tried to end my life because i wont stop having flashbacks and nightmares. I’ve tried countless medication (currently on some now), inpatient therapy and IOP, i even got diagnosed with FND due to me having “fake seizures” which was later explained to be (as my doctor said) a result of my body not being healed from my trauma so it just relives it all causing me to seize. He told me  i needed to have a safe coping mechanism or i will turn into a living vegetable… odd……. 
i have not known peace in my 16years of life, everyday i have nightmares and i wake up in a sweat or hyperventilating. I even thought maybe i wouldn’t have one on my birthday, but instead it was 10x worse. I cannot continue to live this way and i just want to know if anyone knows anything or is going through the same thing. I just need to know its okay and that im not alone please "
227,2,"This is a long story which I apologize in advance for. 

So I was diagnosed with PTSD last year. Don’t want to go into details about it but it’s been interesting to see how my brain has processed after the below happened a couple of hours ago.. 

I was sitting on my back porch listening to YouTube videos (police body cam videos to be exact), nothing crazy serious, just funny interactions with drunk people. I heard someone screaming something that sounded like “Help”, so I paused the video and heard it 4 more times. It wasn’t like a shriek or anything, just a loud yell. I thought it might have been coming from my neighbors house but wasn’t sure because of the headphones still being in. I  got up to investigate and ended up ringing my neighbors doorbell, both the ring doorbell and the classic doorbell, and got no answer. Then I went back to my back porch where I saw another neighbor outside so I went over and asked him if he heard it, and he said he just walked outside and he didn’t. I didn’t know what to do at this point because of a fear of overreacting. I decided to go next door again and actually knock on the door instead of just the doorbell, which I did. I got no answer, so I rang the doorbell again and got nothing. I went back to my back yard and ultimately decided to call the non emergency police dispatch number, which I’ve never had to do (not called 911 before either). They asked me tons of questions and I was just so nervous. The cops showed up and talked to me where I just explained what happened and that I was the one who called. He asked if it sounded like someone in distress or just yelling and I told him I don’t know. My leg was shaking the whole time I spoke with him but I was honest. I told him that sometimes I hear the neighbor kid screaming upstairs playing video games but I had never heard him yell help before. He told me he made contact with them and they were okay. At some point during the encounter, there was a yell in the same direction as the original one that just sounded like someone yelling “UUUUUGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!” which I assume the cop heard because he looked in the direction that it came from. He said he was going to walk around but everything seems okay. He was nice and reassuring but it still freaked me out. I told him that I would stay around if he needed me for anything else. I haven’t heard anything more.

I guess this is the first large situation since I’ve been diagnosed where I’ve been able to consciously notice my symptoms in action. Almost immediately the encounter with the cop became blurry and I began second guessing everything. Was there ever a scream or did I make it up because I was watching police videos? Did the yell while I was talking to the cap actually happen? I know they did, but I was trying to put the blame for the whole situation on myself as a defense mechanism. It solves the unsolved and makes me responsible for the whole thing, which gives me a sense of control. The whole thing is getting more blurry in the background as time goes on, but this was only a couple of hours ago. I waited outside for about an hour around front hoping my neighbors would come out so I could clear the air, and explain why I did what I did. Once again, to give relief after taking responsibility upon myself even after what I did was the right thing to do. 

Trauma is a hell of a thing. It’s been interesting to see my processing in action after a stressful encounter. I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it. I guess I posted just to see if this aligns with anyone else’s experience, get tips for decompression (I know to put myself in a safe comfortable situation, though that is hard to do). Also just to vent a little bit.

Thanks to anyone who has taken the time to read this… typing it out has been therapeutic. "
228,2,"Trigger warning: childhood SA and abuse

EDIT: please go easy on me, this has been INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT to even type out as I’ve kept this in for many, many years and it feel a bit scary to have committed to putting this out there. 

When I was about 9ish yrs old I was groomed and molested by someone we moved  in with (not related by blood) starting when I was in grade 4/5 until about grade 7.  This  triggered anxiety and depression by the time I was in grade 6 and onwards. My mental health declined the older I got and I had counselling for other issues in my life but not for this because I kept it secret as I was too scared and embarrassed and guilty to come forward and tell anyone what happened.  I HUGELY  regret not telling anyone back when I was much younger because my mental health is massively paying for it now as an adult.   

Over the years starting from my teens, I have been on and off various anti depressants to treat my anxiety and depression. I don’t feel like depression is an issue anymore but the anxiety and panic has escalated. There are times where my mind races and my whole body shakes and my anxiety tries to convince me like I’m the one who did something wrong and have something to be guilty of even though I was/am innocent. I don’t know why I feel this way, I live in so much fear, am I stuck in survival mode? 

I thought I could handle it and I was ‘fine’ but each year I seem to be getting worse and it eats at me more and more especially the older I get. My anxiety has now gotten so horrific I feel like I am losing who I am and feel in a constant state of extreme anxiety, OCD, stress and for some reason constant guilt.   

I struggle with intrusive thoughts which freak me out so bad at times I can throw up from I think out of fear. I logically know that I am a good person and have done nothing wrong at all but the intense anxiety makes me feel so much guilt. 

I became hyper sexual in my teens and a bit into my 20’s.  As a late teen I put myself in stupid and risky situations which I’m so thankful didn’t turn out bad. I know it sounds f’kd up but I used to have r@pe ‘fantasies’ and didn’t know why because it’s definitely not something I would actually want in real life. It was not until I was older that I came across information explaining that quite a lot of sexual abuse survivors have this ‘issue’ as a way of regaining some type of control after what had happened to them or something like that. But the older I get the more guilt I even have about having had those fantasies in the past and it makes me physically ill to even think about.  A lot of the time I wonder what the hell is wrong with me. 

I feel like guilt and anxiety is consuming me.  
It’s impacting the quality of life and I can not be happy.  I also experience childhood physical and emotional abuse from others growing up and I feel like I am completely okay with that and have processed it but this issues is what has messed me up. 

Is the guilt possibly a sign that I’m starting to heal or the opposite? 

I am not big on the idea of counselling/therapy again and I am trying to work through this myself.  
I am journalling and trying mindfulness and breathing techniques as well as starting a new anxiety medication 

Sorry for the long read and very unpleasant topic, I guess the point of my post is to see if anyone else who has gone through this or similar feels the way I do so I don’t feel as alone and so I feel validated and not just like I’m losing my mind completely. 

I hope that I can find the strength to get through this and one day I and anyone else who has unfortunately had to face this can find peace. "
229,1,"Does anyone else struggle with accepting that their trauma was so significant that it could result in cPTSD or PTSD?

I feel so much shame. Was he really that abusive? Were his words and mental games really that bad? Did he really hurt me? Could a man really SA his wife? We were married, the cult said I belonged to him…

And was it really that bad that a leader controlled my decisions? Did he really? He was scary, but didn’t I have a choice? Why was I so weak to not just stand up for myself?

Could the decade of all this chaos really be so bad that I now have a mental health issue that affects every area of my life?

I must be too dramatic, or I’m making this up. It can’t be this bad. My mom doesn’t understand. And now I have no friends. So I still with the voices inside my head and really question if any of what I’m feeling or doing is even valid. "
230,0,"Most people judge the visible failure of a damaged adult but ignore the invisible cause: parental abuse. When a mother or father humiliates, beats, or terrorizes a child, they inflict measurable psychological injury. Even a child born healthy can end up with anxiety, depression, and self-destructive habits because a parent chose violence instead of care.

Society then stamps that survivor as “broken,” “bad,” or “unfit,” while the real offender escapes scrutiny. This is intolerable. Unless the victim possesses exceptional resilience and resources, the accumulated harm can destroy education, relationships, and career. Meanwhile children of average ability but decent parents advance without obstacles.

I am disgusted that abusers often receive more sympathy than the children they cripple. Excuses like “the parent was stressed” or “they had a hard life” change nothing. Assaulting a defenseless child is a crime. Responsibility is non-negotiable.

Many adults are unfit to raise children. Parenting is a duty that demands self-control, patience, and basic knowledge of child development. It is a privilege, not an automatic right. Effective oversight and strict consequences are necessary.

Morals and ethics come from schools, religions, and civic institutions, yet progress happens only when informed adults speak out. Children cannot defend themselves, adults must do it for them.

Stop excusing abusive parents. Stand with the victims."
231,2,"After the flood, I was diagnosed with acute PTSD. My family and I had to flee from our home. The things we saw were less than pleasant, but could have been worse I know. I had not had a single panic attack but anxiety showing in different ways since the flood (Sep). However, I think I had an “episode” of full dissociation, and that had never happened prior.

We were at a cookout and up on a pretty flat surface. The sky grew dark for a storm coming. It had stormed several times since Helene (so I’m not sure why this would he triggered me). I was sitting at the table and felt how strong the wind was. All of the sudden I felt an incredibly strong sense of Deja vu, like I had been there before and I wasn’t supposed to be. I felt my blood pump through my arms, my hearing went muffled and vision blurred. Nausea came after. I don’t remember anything other than those feelings  in that moment. I was trying to explain to my bf on the phone on the way home and felt like I was out of my body AGAIN! Almost like I was in a dream. I have never felt this out of control before and to be honest, it scared the heck out of me. 

I got home, exhausted, and don’t remember much of the rest of that night. And when I say exhausted, I mean I could barely function. Could this be delayed onset PTSD? Or do I need to go to the doctor to be checked for seizures? Lol I have to laugh or I will cry!"
232,1,"So I went to my cousin‘s graduation party and got him a present and just to come to find out I’m not even allowed to hang out with him because his family doesn’t want me to. I don’t know what’s worse, trying to put myself out there to meet people and to be a part of people’s life just to get a shot down for people who don’t understand my circumstances in life. This includes my own family. It’s not for the lack of trying and among excusing my behavior from my PTSD.But it’s frustrating when my own family only sees the disability, not me.I feel completely alone in this world….and it’s just so frustrating and all I want to do is cry all tho no matter how hard I try ……I got to therapy I take my meds ….and it’s just all sad and I’m not looking for sympathy just venting ….."
233,1,"I was having a nap with my wife and youngest son on the sofa.
Its rare but it was really nice I was leaning on her n kid on her legs. Our oldest (9) was next to me on his phone. 

I'd had a regular lucid dream I get them sometimes. But was having nightmares too. 
This one I know I was asleep but not dreaming it was really strange. 

I don't know what happend I full on pulled away like something was at me. I normally remeber with having the lucid dreams but I didn't. 
The issue tho was I kept my eyes shut to try fall back asleep
 My wife on instinct woke up n put her arm against my chest(sometimes I push or hit back) my oldest did the same to keep pressure on me. 

I felt like crying my eyes out that he had to do that so i pretended I was asleep I didn't want to answer his questions  i know he would have if i showen i was alwake. and I know I'd breakdown with how bad I felt. 

My son shouldn't have to reausre me. I am in like a limbo in my mind I know this is going to keep me up and pick and bite at me I just don't know how to feel about it "
234,2,"Hi all, 20f here. I've had PTSD most of my life from adverse childhood events and different things, but recently it's gotten significantly worse. As of nearly a month ago, I escaped a verbally, emotionally, and sexually abusive relationship that I was in for 7 months; I made it out as things started taking a turn towards physical abuse. The police arrested my ex and issued a no-contact so I had time to get a restraining order, and I did get the restraining order after a week or so. 

But, I still might report my ex for numerous rapes and sexual assaults and I sort of started the process by calling my local District Attorney and asking for information on what would happen if I report a sexual assault and they pick up charges. It's pretty stressful but I have to do it for me and anyone else my ex may hurt in the future. 

So anyways, I have really severe PTSD right now and a lot of people close to me are concerned about Stockholm Syndrome, too. I hallucinate my ex a lot and think I hear him, see him, smell him, or feel him touching me when he's gone. Any time I hear a loud car I instinctively check to make sure it's not his car. I cry most of the time when I shower and sometimes avoid my bedroom because we were in there a lot. Random words or phrases will make me remember something and I lose time for a bit when that happens. When I heard my ex's car pulling up outside the courthouse for the restraining order hearing, I got so ill I thought I was going to pass out. 

I have dreams involving him almost every night but a majority of the time, they're violent or scary and become nightmares. I have a lot of guilt over living my life without him and I still have a sense of loyalty to him. I feel like I'm ""cheating"" if I'm alone with anyone or if someone touches me. I still can't get rid of the things he bought me or the Polaroids we took together. I get scared he can hear and see everything I'm doing because he always told me he's ""ten steps ahead"" and he used to ""have people watching me and my family"" even when we weren't together. I'll literally be talking to a police officer or in a protected DV shelter and I still worry he will somehow know what I'm saying or doing. Every once in a while I'd find that I put on the ring that he bought me without even realizing and once I do notice I cry when I go to take it off. So I had to put the ring in a box on my shelf with the rest of the things I have from our relationship. 

I still feel like I'm HIS and it's really, really hard for me to know what to do with myself nowadays because all I did before was exist FOR him. Every thought I had was about him. Will this make him upset? Is he upset at me? Will he hurt me? Did he really do that the other night? What can I do to make him happy? This is my fault right? What if I miss one of his texts and he gets angry again?

I'm still rediscovering my favorite color these days. 

I see a therapist weekly but most of our sessions are focusing on documentation for when I report my ex, so we've been going through different events in the relationship and thoroughly talking about those. I'm also attending a group for survivors at a DV shelter that starts soon. 

I have tried several psychiatric medications in the past. I'm considered allergic to (because of super adverse reactions) Prozac, Lamictal, and Abilify. I took Lexapro for a long time but stopped it because I was unable to cry which was extremely frustrating and I felt less like myself than before I took it. I take a low dose of Propranolol for Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome when I need it, and it does help slightly with anxiety symptoms, but not nearly enough to have a decent day, yet. I have some Hydroxyzine too, but that usually just makes me sleepy and causes pretty vivid dreams and nightmares. I have Seroquel at a 12.5 mg sleep dose and I used to take 25mg nightly, but it makes me too tired and zombie-ish to take that often. 

What have your experiences been with medication for PTSD and/or nightmares? I'd love to know. I have an appointment with my doctor in a month and I want to discuss ideas for medication with him then.

235,1,"I'm gonna keep it brief and keep the details short bc I'm debating on filing an EEOC claim regarding this. 

I had a sobbing attack at work. Loud, but entirely away from people. When I went to return to my work, my coworkers asked me if I was okay and I started to say ""No! I'm okay!"" but I started sobbing holding onto my knees again.

The latter, my boss described the behavior as ""unsettling,"" and I'm so triggered. I was yelling at my boyfriend today that it's just a matter of time before he leaves me because he'll see how everyone else sees I'm a monster. I felt like I've made **so** many moves and waves and progress in not feeling like people can just glance at me and see I'm a monster (granted, largely by hiding my past with humor & dissociating from it more), but what is just... crying... like sobbing... being a monstrous, ""unsettling,"" act like,,,

Like... how am I supposed to ever have even a decent life like this."
236,0,"(Preface. I hope this isn’t too “dark humor”-y. I hope it can be more lighthearted, sometimes I find it healing to speak of my origin story in a casual way with other ptsd people 🫶)

If you don’t get the title, I mean did you get ptsd from almost dying in a final destination type way? In a way that makes you think death personified must be coming for you AND your bloodline? 🤣 Your PTSD is the first of its kind, patient zero style

I have ptsd from being in a car that went underwater (10% survival rate IF it happens at all which is apparently never). I was watching this video of “close calls” yesterday and I realized.. this video must be FULL of other people with their own brand new type of PTSD too!!

237,1,I healed from PTSD 3 years ago and since then life just feels grey and boring to me. I don’t have motivation to do stuff anymore. I am able to work now but I just cant escape this feeling. Is this what normal life feels like? I was manic due to the PTSD so of course life feels different now. After treatment I changed a lot and became so introverted and antisocial. 
238,0,"So I'm kind of embarrassed to ask these questions since I feel like I should know but hopefully someone can help me.

What exactly is maladaptive day dreaming? 

What is disassociation?

And does anyone else twitch when you're stressed? 

I know I can google all this but I'm hoping to get some personal experiences with the answers.

239,0,"Hi everyone. I understand this group is not a spiritual one, but maybe someone out there needs to hear it. I’m a survivor of domestic violence and an attempted murder. The trauma left my nervous system in ruins—constant hypervigilance, nightmares, dissociation, the works.

From my ex I ended up fled to my sister’s home, thinking I’d be safe. Turns out she was part of a pseudo-spiritual MLM disguised as shamanism. That broke my heart and spirit in a new way.  I have great respect of cultures and paths of spirituality and quickly noticed red flags but amongst those was something true.  So in this wreckage, I met someone else—an Iranian mystic and culture keeper, a sole survivor of a genocide.

He didn’t call it PTSD. He called it “ghost sickness.” In his culture, the nervous system isn’t just biology—it’s home to spirits, memory, and ancestral burdens. The “Djinn,” he said, live in the spine. When you’re traumatized, they start acting out. Twitching. Screaming. Running away.

It sounds fantastical. But when I began treating my trauma as a spiritual injury—not just a mental one—things changed.

I started combining nervous system work with old-world rituals. I talked to my body like it was a scared child. I made offerings, sat in silence, burned herbs, and cried in candlelight. I remembered things I’d locked away. And I felt them and moved them out.
Slowly, my system has calmed. I’m not cured, but I’m here, free of the voices of shame I recognized as my abusers haunting me after I left.  I’ve since helped others in similar situations using a mix of spiritual grounding, heritage knowledge, and somatic tools. No fluff, no bypassing—just embodied care, through very old ways.

I’m still quiet about this path because spiritual spaces can be toxic and performative. But I’m posting here in case someone else is where I was—stuck between a clinical world that doesn’t feel quite right and a spiritual world that feels too far gone.
You’re not crazy if your healing looks different. You’re not alone if what finally helps you is a little “strange.” You’re still healing. That’s what matters.

If anyone’s curious, I’m happy to share what worked for me—or just listen to your story. We’re not broken. We’re can be haunted. And that means we can be un-haunted too.

240,1,"I don't believe I'll ever recover from ptsd and it will eventually kill me. I've managed to convince myself that I can't reach out to anyone because no one cares. Why would they? My problems have nothing to do with them and they'll never be able to help me when I don't even know WHAT will help. I think my therapist got so busy in her life that she forgot about me. I don't know how much longer I can continue pretending to be happy to not upset or worry anyone around me. I'm a hopeless, lost cause."
241,0,"Hi - I have just recently started on Prazosin for nightmares. I was a bit concerned about starting it because my blood pressure can often be low and is usually on the low side of normal. Because of this, I was started on 0.5mgs. I didn't expect it to be helpful at this dose but it seems to be helping me sleep and I can't really remember any dreams or nightmares so far.

So I have C-PTSD from being abused as a kid (3 years ago, I'm 15 now). Sometimes I get hallucinations of semi-humanlike beings or monsters out of the corner of my eye.

Other than C-PTSD and autism spectrum disorder (lvl 1) I don't have any other diagnosed or suspected conditions that could cause this. Does anyone else get this?

My derealization and paranoia manifest in public places as me hearing the abusers voices and seeing their faces in other people. I literally see them. I literally hear them.

And guess what? It was a stranger. This part of my paranoia eats me up. I don’t go anywhere alone if I can help it. And I mean ANYWHERE. My job involves constant contact with people and my performance suffers because I disobey the rules in order to distract myself. It sucks. I need this job. But it’s definitely not a job that goes well with PTSD. I break down. I get sent home. I feel quite hopeless for my working ability. "
245,1,"Hey I'm new to this group. Diagnosed over 2 years ago with PTSD however now as I'm being referred for ADHD tests my childhood has come up a lot in conversations. 
It seems to be resurfacing that alot of my experiences as an only child with a single mother were actually CSA. At least I'm considering viewing them as CSA and CA but even with a lot of research I can't seem to pinpoint anybody who has gone through something similar to my experience, it was both emotional torture, emotional incest, physical abuse and I think I was SA'd as a child. Has anybody else had this with a one child single parent household? 

For all my life it just made sense that what my mum said and did was normal because I had nothing to compare it to. 
She didn't like people she couldn't manipulate being in my life so there werent many responsible family members or adult friends around so a lot of terrible and crazy shit happened in front of my eyes whilst underage. 

I was hyper sexual, even as a child, I would go into primary school and flash all the boys in the playground because I guess that was how I thought I could get people to like me. This is a sign right? 

I think she groomed me to be a perfect victim, all whilst I was unknowing and had no one to help me. 
Things like showing me what 'men like' and things about me that 'men would never find attractive. Shaming me for not fitting the conventional beauty standards like she tried so hard to do. 

She had me taking nude and provocative photos of her for her social media before the age of 11. 
Including telling me to take pictures of her feet in high heels because she said she spoke to men who 'loved her feet'. 

Before the age of 10 my mother had me regularly wax her ass (yes hole) ready for when she would next be seeing her boyfriend, I think even at the age I knew why she would force me to do this and I knew the implications on what she would be doing with her boyfriend. 

At all ages I can remember hearing her and random men having sex at all hours of the night in the bedroom beside my bed and I would even bang on the wall to tell them to stop and whenever I did my mum would get louder and it made me really uncomfortable. 

Regular drug use and drug dealing occurred within the home which my mother told people I had no idea which was in fact not true, she knew I was aware of it. 

One time I came home at around the age of 14 and without being informed of anyone being in my home, I found a tall skinny white man who I'd never met prior with his top half under my bed looking through my draws. I later found out that my mother was in the living room and she said she was upset with him so I didn't think much of it after she kicked him out. About 2 weeks later he was sat on my mums bed and as I came home from being out with my friends she made him apologise to me for perving on me and looking at my things. I think she may have organised an exchange for drugs or payments because she knew this guy was a sex offender. 

She also dated multiple child sex offenders throughout my childhood and multiple addicts. Some even encouraged inappropriate things but I do feel my mother was the initator of my abuse. 

When she found a social media account I had made to talk to men when I was 13 because I over sexualised myself due to her parenting, she made me delete it and then made me help her set up an account on the same dating platform and showed me how to do it correctly with pictures of her in lingerie and she would talk to some of the same men who spoke to me, with absolutely no remorse. She actually found it fun I think. 

When she found out I had a boyfriend when I was almost 16, I was to scared to tell her I was sexually active so she forced out of me that we had 'done stuff' because I didn't know what else to say and she called his mother blaming her and screaming at her. Due to this the parents of my friends or boyfriends tended to help me out because they could see my mother was literally insane. 

She would make me sleep in her bed with her rather than going to my own bed, then whenever I moved or made a noise she would accuse me of touching myself sexually whilst laying next to her. Like what the fuck? As a parent now of a daughter I couldn't be more disgusted by this. 

This is only some of the horrifying stories of growing up with her

Please I just need some validation that in not going crazy and this is incestuous and abuse???

246,2,"Hi, I have epilepsy and have grand-mal seizures. I have had a lot of seizures outside but have also had some indoors. I’m on epilim (epilepsy medication) and a side affect of this is tremors (uncontrollable movements), but i also had 2 more side affects which included double and blurred vision. I’ve been on epilim for 10 months and the other 2 side affects went away about 6 months ago, but I still have the tremors and shaky hands which doesn’t make sense if it’s because of the meds because I’d assume they’d go away but they’re not… which is leading me to believe it could be something else. I feel like I’m not in control of my body, and it’s a lot worse when I’m outside, especially alone. I check my pulse rate basically all the time because my heart rate is higher than it used to be prior to the seizures. When I’m outside I’m in constant fear of having a seizure. It’s really bad now, it’s been like this since the seizures started (3 years ago). I do have really bad health anxiety and this has been happening since the seizures, and I also know that people with PTSD are at higher risk of developing health anxiety. I am going to go to the doctor to talk to them about it, even if it isn’t PTSD (🤞), I do want to see a therapist. Does anyone think it could be PTSD? Or maybe know what else it could be? I do want help"
247,2,"I've been through severe repeated trauma involving mobile phones and as a result I've developed an extreme fear and disgust of them. Every time I see one I go into panic mode. I don't know how to escape this trigger, it's everywhere, it's reminding me of the trauma and I'm losing my mind."
248,0,Why?
249,2,"So two years ago I had this short fling (4 months) with a guy that was really toxic and ended on bad terms and resulted in an 8 month psychotic episode on my part. I’ve been to multiple therapists since then who all agree that I have ptsd from it but I just have trouble believing that since it was so short and it wasn’t violent at all. It was really just manipulative, we weren’t even in an actual relationship but he held the idea of one over my head to get me to have sex with him. Thing is that even still to this day I get hyperaroused when I think about it and get racing heart beat, clenching jaw, anger, tears, all of it. I just want to move on from it but I can’t seem to. "
250,2,I had a night terror for the first time in 3 years. I woke up the other night in some sort of trance sweaty my heart was in my throat. It's hard to explain what I was feeling other than Dread and complete terror. The whole time I was staring at the wall begging for someone to end me it was Terrifying. It felt like I wasn't the one in control those Words weren't mine. I don't know how I'm gonna deal with this again I live on my own now and I don't have any support.
251,1,"Hello
 
 I, 7 monthes ago had an attempt to take my life. I feel like recently Ive had random flash backs of everything that happened and just causes me to break down. I dont know if this is the correct subreddit but if it is, if anyone is able to provide any sort of advice please let me know. I cant seem to distract myself or stop thinking about it until it feels like the episode leaves itself. I cant even look at places or think of people the same. Its causing me so much distress and Im worried my therapist and psychitrist will get the wrong idea and take it as a future attempt plan.

Edit: What do you consider PTSD traits and how to cope."
252,3,I cannot sleep whatsoever for days. Any suggestions??? I’m open to whatever. 
253,1,"it’s been 8 years since he first put his hands on me.
3 years since i finally left.
but honestly? i still feel like i never really got out. i’m free in the physical sense, i don’t see him, don’t live in that house anymore.
but emotionally, mentally, i’m still buried in it.
in the grief. in the silence. in the feeling that something in me never made it out. he never wanted to be a dad.
he begged me to end both pregnancies.
told me flat-out he wasn’t ready, that he couldn’t do it. and for years, he didn’t. he was drunk most of their lives.
missing. detached.
i did everything, diapers, feedings, first steps, first words, while he stumbled in and out of the picture with a bottle in his hand. he barely showed up. for four years, our oldest didn’t have a real father. for three, our youngest didn’t even know what one looked like. but the second i left? that’s when he decided to become “dad.” not out of love. not because he changed. but because controlling them meant he could still control me. and the courts let him. and now… i’m the one erased.
i’m the one on the outside looking in on my own kids’ lives. it feels like everything froze on december 6, 2021. the day everything shifted.
the day the silence became deafening.
i swear, time stopped moving after that.
the world kept spinning, but i didn’t.
i’m still stuck in that day,  in what was taken from me. i live in constant fear now.
not just of never seeing them again, but of losing them forever. i have nightmares about them dying. dreams where i’m at their funeral.
where i get the call. where i’m screaming and no one hears me. i wake up gasping, heart pounding, feeling like i already lost them.
and the worst part? some days, those dreams feel more real than my memories.people don’t understand what this kind of pain does to a person. how it warps time. how it robs you of breath. how it’s not just sadness, it’s this chronic, aching absence that never lets up. i’ve tried everything.
therapy. medication. being honest. being strong. being vulnerable.
and still, i feel like i’m failing.
like healing is this thing dangled in front of me that i never get to hold. and i’m tired.
not just physically, existentially.
tired of waking up in a body that still remembers the trauma.
tired of pretending i’m okay when i feel like a ghost in my own life.
tired of surviving when i’m barely living.
i don’t want to be told i’m strong.
i don’t want to hear “it gets better.”
i want my kids back.
i want to hear their laughter in my home.
i want to be their mom in the way that counts. and until that happens,
i just keep breathing. not because i want to, 
but because something in me refuses to let go. even when it feels like everything else already has."
254,2,"CW: drugs/abuse

please bear with me if i seem unorganized or ansty or whatever. i have CPTSD and im diagnosed also

i feel so awful for not being able to get over a situation that happened in late 2023 - early 2024. i've been struggling with the anniversary dates for each traumatic event in this period of time i like to call 'the reign of terror' (november 2023 - august 2024). what happened was when i was 13-14 years old, my parent got heavily addicted to drugs. this wasn't apparent until february when they left my other parent and started going into a state of psychosis. it was this constant back and forth of my parents both feeding me traumatic information about the other until it started manifesting when they started living together again. my addicted parent started going crazy near april and has gone to the lengths of hurting herself and others. it went on like this for months with constant different situations, i just can't remember much anymore. this has left a stain on who i am as a person, and i'm completely unable to function in public on bad days because of how many triggers i get from everyday objects. i know that this is my own problem to deal with, but it's so hard to do without any resources and i feel bad for making it another person's problem because of how i can't regulate myself. i feel horrible for having other people deal with my flashbacks, or my sudden mood switches because of how i rabbit hole into something triggering. i feel like i can't function properly anymore because of my trauma and no matter what i try to do to process or regulate myself, it just ends up throwing me back to the same flashback and to the same state of mind i once was in. i feel horrible"
255,3,"I have problems sleeping due to my PTSD. I don’t have nightmares so bad anymore but I do have very vivid dreams and if I wake up in the night (I have to bc I have a baby) I will have a nightmare. I’ll be in bed for 8 hours but only sleep about 4-5 hours of that. I need very unconventional methods that have helped you. So far I’ve tried: white noise, podcast, instrumental music, reading, meditation, journaling, yoga, eating healthy, limiting screen time, mantras. A shot of vodka before bed helps me sleep without nightmares but I really don’t want to do that because alcohol isn’t great for your liver. 

How do you guys get better sleep? I’ve started to seek out medicinal remedies for my sleep issues. What helped you guys?"
256,2,"CW: DV/Abuse

I got into a serious relationship extremely young and when I say young I mean young. I was 12 and started dating this girl, it was my first relationship, and my first introductory to my bisexuality in the form of a wlw relationship.

For the first couple months of us dating, I was really in love, or what I thought was in love as a 12-year-old, everything seemed to be going perfect and I genuinely thought that I would marry this girl or at least be with her for a long time. 

Eventually, as most of you who have been in DV relationships know, it took a turn for the worse. I was 12 and I had no one guiding me, no one telling me that these things weren’t normal. I grew up with a rough home life and parents that didn’t really care about me, if anything they encouraged the relationship because “at least I wasn’t out doing stuff with a boy.” 

It started with more innocent stuff like I had never had intercourse before )seeing as I was 12) and she kind of pressured me into doing it, I don’t consider it SA because it’s not like she forced me to do it and she was only a year older than me. It’s not like there was a huge age gap or I was being taken advantage of. Eventually, she pushed me to try more sexual things, more than I was comfortable with. I had no knowledge of the world or mental illness or how it worked, and she used to tell me that she was diagnosed with schizophrenia, and that the only way to stop her from having “hallucinations“ Was to have sex with her. So she basically manipulated me and would pretend to have a “episode“ whenever she wanted sex, even if I didn’t want to do it

Whenever we would have an argument or I would want to do something with any of my friends or hang out with my family or do anything that didn’t involve her she would cut herself and send me pictures of it. She would send me pictures of her laying on railroad tracks saying that she was gonna lay there until a train came. At one point she moved back home with her father to her home state (only for a few months) and she sent me a picture of her on top of a tall building saying she was going to jump off and then stopped answering me for hours. 

She would do this all the time anytime she felt like I was having social interactions outside of her she would threaten to kill herself and then not answer me for hours leaving me scared and worried for her. Eventually it escalated and whenever we would argue, she would slap me and then it escalated more and one time she punched me so hard my back molar came out 

Still no one stepped in and did anything. Everyone knew it was going on, the police had been called a few times and no one cared. I felt so alone like there was nothing I could do. Eventually, whenever I turned 14 after trying to break up with her so many times and failing, I tried to kill myself. I had to stay in the mental hospital for a week and whenever I got back, we tried to hang out a few more times And I blame myself so much for that I should’ve just stopped talking to her. But eventually, I did fully break up with her. 

She then went on to tell people, and all of my friends, that I was the abusive one and I sexually assaulted her whenever she was having a “schizophrenic“ episode. This made my high school career extremely hard. She’s super manipulative so everyone believed her and thought that I was a horrible person. It was really rough. I felt very very alone. no one believed me because like I said she was manipulative and many other girls went on to date her because they didn’t believe me. All of those girls after breaking up with her came to me and told me that they were sorry for not believing me and that she did the same thing to them. 

Last year she got arrested for sodomy in the 3rd degree, in my state that means that she had sex with a minor under 16. It was a 14 year-old girl, she was 20. I don’t really know what happened with the case, but I know that she spent a few months in jail. I also know that she got out a few months ago. I only know this because she came into my job for an interview. It caused me immense stress, and I had a full panic attack at my job which thankfully they didn’t hire her, but it makes me wonder. Did she see me at work? I don’t want her to know where I work. I’m terrified of her. Did she apply because I work there? Seeing her really caught me off guard because honestly I was starting to get over the trauma that she’s caused me or at least I got better about letting it affect me so much. But when I saw her again, I felt like the same 12-year-old girl I was whenever she abused me. 

A few weeks ago I was at target with my boyfriend and I saw her and thankfully he was there to calm me down so my panic attack wasn’t as bad as whenever I saw her at work. I hate her so much. I wish she would just move away, get away from me. When she was in jail, I didn’t have to worry about if I would see her out in public and have a panic attack but now that’s something I have to fear whenever I go out. I know I shouldn’t be scared of her anymore because it’s not like she can do anything to me now, but that trauma is still so raw to me. Not only did she traumatize me by abusing me mentally and physically, but she also ruined my social life and made it extremely hard for me to make friends in high school because of the lies that she spread about me. 

I’m sorry this is long and I know no one will probably read until the end, but I feel like I have no one to talk to. I know that my boyfriend gets tired of hearing about it even if he doesn’t say that he is tired of it. I just needed to get it out to someone besides him.

259,1,"I do not have PTSD. I’m wondering if my mother does. do people without PTSD get night terrors?

My mom only started getting night terrors after my dad became physically abusive towards her. It’s been years since the abuse happened , but she still wakes up screaming occasionally. We never really talk about the abuse, we just talk about how horrible my dad is.

Sometimes she wakes up screaming.  Sometimes she will also jump out of bed and run out of her room. By the time she’s right outside of her bedroom door she fully wakes up.

I just realized this might be PTSD. I guess no one can diagnose her here. But I just feel terrible for my mom. "
260,1,"It’s been about 6 months since the three year long emotional abuse stopped, I’ve been told I have to get therapy etc. I have severe flashbacks and severe episodes that make me lash out at people I love if I get even a little bit triggered. 
But I don’t want help? I don’t want to stop feeling bad I want to keep feeling bad and I don’t know why, I thought about it and came to that realization. 
Why do I want to keep feeling bad?? Why don’t I want help if I know I’m in so much pain to the point where suicide has been on my mind for months? "
261,2,"Ah yes, thank you Sharon, I’ll just hit the giant “Do Not Relive Trauma” button in my brain like it’s a snooze alarm.

262,1,"This is a throwaway account because I’m just so unsure of how to feel about all of this and I don’t know what to do. 

I know this was absolutely childhood trauma, but I’m still incredibly confused about it all. (I am a girl btw)

Aside from growing up with a narcissistic and alcoholic father and an emotionally abusive oldest brother, there was something absolutely horrendous that happened to me as a very young child. 

When I was around 2-3 years old, about when I started having memories, I had to go to the ER and get a urinary catheter inserted WITHOUT any type of sedation, anesthesia, pain relief medicine or ANYTHING. 

I vividly remember screaming and crying in agony and my mother begging the doctor (who was a VERY rude, cold, mean, grumpy old man) to at least give me SOME sort of pain relief, all while the doctor and nurses were forcefully holding me down and basically yelling at me to stop screaming and hold still. 

Remember, I was a toddler, no older than 2 or 3, and I’m having my legs forced open while they carelessly shove a tube up my urethra WITHOUT any kind of lubricant, numbing cream, or anything. (Again, I’m a girl.)

Eventually my mom convinced them to put me under anesthesia since I was in so much agonizing, excruciating pain and would not stop freaking out. 

I don’t remember much after that besides the car ride home late at night and I remember the feeling of the catheter up inside of me was incredibly uncomfortable, but all I could do was wait a few days until they could remove it (which I don’t remember). 

This is where it gets even worse. My parents never got me any sort of counseling or therapy from this and never spoke to me about it, even when I had questions. I eventually developed a strong, almost obsessive curiosity with my lady bits and would constantly think about them. 

Well one time when I was around 5 maybe, there was a girl a year older than me who rode the same school bus and she showed me a “game” involving showing/touching each other’s private areas. 

This lead to me thinking it was normal and something every kid did for fun, and I ended up introducing other kids my age to the same “game”. 

I feel an intense amount of guilt and self-hatred for this. I mean I know I was only a kid with unresolved trauma (which I didn’t even know I had until years later) but I still beat myself up for it all the time. I tell myself I’m not worthy of finding love or romance because I don’t deserve it after what I did. I just wish I could go back in time and do everything differently. "
263,2,"My ptsd stems from a lot of things, but the first huge traumatic event in my life (on top of other traumatic things going on) was my mom’s death. It feels like every year the anniversary comes up I’m filled with anxiety and sadness. 

I’m just really struggling today, I just got back from visiting my aunts house (my moms sister) and as much as I love being there, it’s also one of the last family homes we have where she had visited alive. It makes me miss her so much being around my aunt, she’s so much like her (and her kids have everything I never could, I’m truly happy for them). Anyways, my mom’s death anniversary is this month. It’ll be 14 years without her. There’s so many things I wish she had been here to protect me from, and the anniversary of those things coincide with summer in general. 

I used to love the summer, but now I can’t even enjoy it because I’m having anxiety attacks multiple times a day. I usually try to keep things to myself but it’s a lot to hold in and I thought talking about it anywhere would help, especially with people who understand.

Note: my mom’s death isn’t the reason for my ptsd, it started before that but I was so young it made things a lot worse for me."

 in the last few weeks  I developed nightmares of him being in my flat and killing my pet rabbits who are my babies. I have nightmares anyway due to cptsd but never ones directly to do with his psychosis. I also had one small flashback and one lucid dream where I saw him breaking into my flat. I suddenly started deeply hating him in the last few weeks even though we have still been close and a true fear of him. I cried for about 4 hours when I very rarely cry. I have seen my therapist and seen him which I feel a bit better about. 

I am sure I have developed ptsd. Are these flare up sort symptoms similar to other people?"

(I'm autistic, so there's probably some executive dysfunction there too. ADHD test came back negative.)

It's like all my shitty brain wants to do is make me curl up in a fetal position in bed with my childhood comfort plush and avoid/procrastinate everything forever instead of ever getting anything done. The days fly by way too fast because of this and the cycle repeats itself...

I'm always either frozen in fear for no reason when I feel like I ""have"" to do something, or I'm so restless that I have to stim/pace around in front of screens and lights for visual sensory because I constantly feel both under and overstimulated at the same time.

I have a lot of authority related trauma from school growing up, but now I live by myself with no one to be ""perfect"" for, and it's almost like simply existing makes me so uncomfortable that it makes me feel stuck and squirmy and drives me to smoke to calm my nerves, I don't know what's wrong with me or how to stop all of this.

I've tried the Finch app multiple times to try and stay organized, but unfortunately even the cute birds don't motivate me enough to unfreeze and take care of them consistently, which makes me feel awful for ""letting them down"".

What else can I do?? What am I doing wrong? I don't understand why I'm like this no matter how hard I try to analyze what I'm feeling. I don't understand what's triggering my fight or flight 24/7 when my life overall besides this has been great recently.

I actually get kinda upset that I can’t tell people what happened to me because people don’t need to hear that, they don’t need to hold that for me they don’t deserve to hear it ect. But I just wish SO BADLY I could tell everyone exactly what happened and have someone understand or comfort me or even just so people can actually understand me as a person fully "

275,1,"I have C- PTSD along with other rare invisible illnesses so it impacts my daily functioning to work. I consider myself an outgoing person but it’s hard at my age bc everyone is married or has kids so I feel alone like an outsider. How do I keep not wanting to give up? This is not a cry for help, I been in therapy for decades dealing with my trauma. It just feels alone and tiring on top of lack of emotional support of family. I don’t expect anyone to be anything because in last long term relationship, I was told it was draining and damaging to always share my feelings and struggles about having Complex PTSD. It really is an invisible illness and frustrating when u are alone. I think it should be named the “abandoned invisible” 😔"
276,2,"I was in Habbiniyah Iraq 06-08. 11B.
I am in tears more than ever now and it’s usually from my wife. Just being plain old mean and then comes up with something I did well over a year ago maybe longer in some cases to justify herself. My real issue is while we were dating I had come to a point I felt comfortable enough to get out what I’ve held in for almost 20 years at that point. It was such a relief but, now and for a while I’ll hear, “you can only use your ptsd as an excuse for so long.” Or “I’m not doing this anymore, you always playing the victim.” Mainly referring to my lack of memory. Let’s not mention the tbi or epilepsy. I can only use my ptsd as an excuse for so long??? What?! And I never say, I acted or said this or that because of ptsd. Never do I use that as reasoning. My memory, yeah it’s legit trash, that’s no excuse. You swear up and down you love your husband but say some of the meanest things I’ve ever heard and then get degraded for crying cause your wife you love is being nothing less than mean. I can’t tell her my feelings without it getting turned around on me so I just don’t talk about my feelings and when I’m forced to cause she can tell something is wrong I say I’m fine but she keeps pushing until I tell her what’s going on in my head and then it gets turned around on me. It’s a lose lose for me. She swears she loves me and I’ve said I don’t see it. Completely ignores when I call her out, like I never even said anything. I’ve cried more in the last 6 months than I have in 39 years. I love my wife more than anything idk what to do with myself."
277,2,Ever since I was 11 I had this feeling that something bad happened to me something I couldn’t remember. This gnawing feeling inside. I never told anyone because it would seem crazy. I just know something happened it makes feel uneasy and feel crazy.  
278,2,"For context I am 19 years old and have had an extremely traumatic childhood, I wasn't beaten or physically abused however I have been neglected all my life on top of the fact that I have been sick my entire life, around 7 years ago I was diagnosed with POTS and had an extremely horrific array of symptoms with it, I was unable to feel my limbs I was unable to walk, I was in constant head pain and in a constant state of fear and isolation. I would sit awake in the middle of the night wondering if I would wake up the next day or not, i can't even begin to describe how terrifying it was to be a preteen and practically having your body falling apart. It took me just about 4 years to get my symptoms under control and begin to move forwards, but I am worried it has had adverse effects on my mind.

I suffer constantly from unbearable nightmares about that time in my life, I have been described by a great deal of people in my life to be hyper paranoid and vigilant, I am a chronic insomniac and I am extremely quick to anger. There are certain things that remind me of that time in my life that cause me to become extremely agitated and freak out, I am wondering if this might be PTSD or some analogue to it?"
279,0,"This is a success story it just may not seem like it. My daughter was assaulted which triggered me badly. I went 30 years without anyone in my family believing me about my assault and any of the times after that. When it happened to my daughter I saw red! I became the person I need 30 years ago, this is where the success story comes in. I just went up against a very skilled attorney and won a 3 year SAPO for my daughter. The fight isn’t over, but doing this healed a part of my soul that has been broken for many decades. I cried in the fetal position for what felt like hours, but was only minutes finally releasing those demons. It felt great. I won not just for me, but for her and every child out there. It set a precedent today. My inner child is now playing in the field with her horses again. I feel at peace today. "
280,3,"I'm a female (in my 20s) and both me and my partner had to move into his parents house for a while but we're finally moving out later this year.

There's been a huge blow out over the last few months, his dad got caught cheating with men and then came out as gay after 40 years of marriage so as you can tell this house has been like a warzone. His mum dosent want to be with him anymore but has to stay with him financially(and also I suspect codependency as they've never not had eachother) but they truly hate eachother. He screams at her at like 1am and this morning is woke up with him screaming ""I can't change who I am why can't you just get over it"" over and over again. They're both in therapy, it's not helping when they both refuse to leave. 

I have c-ptsd i was in a very long abusive relationship both physically and mentally tortured. My biggest trigger is shouting and loud noises, they're both aware of this and MIL always tries to keep this in mind and prefers texting him if she has something to discuss and then he barges upstairs to start screaming. 

I literally jolted awake this morning and thought I was back in the past when I heard it.

I decided to text him earlier today and explain that I have diagnosed ptsd + bpd and I can't deal with the screaming and throwing things as it brings me back to a very dark place and he read it and ignored it, came home and started slamming doors and throwing things again.

I am stuck here for the next few months until our place is ready and I am grateful that they've let us stay here(we do pay towards things) but I just don't know what to do, ive basically become a free therapist to MIL and with all the screaming and banging I feel like I'm loosing my mind. I am on edge constantly.

This is just a rant, no one can fix this situation since they don't want to fix it themselves im just counting down the days until we're out, but then also dealing with the guilt of both being there for MIL when we're gone."

TLDR: Uncle groomed & raped me when I was 15 and he was 28, now he's out of rehab and moving back to Australia to live with my dad, who has no idea any of that happened... - IDK wtf to do

I couldn't find any other subs that would allow a post like this, but I guess I just need to talk about it and I'm wondering what you would do in my situation. 

I never knew my bio dad until I was a teenager, or any of his family. My mom got pregnant with me when she was 16 and she hid it until she was too big to do so anymore. By the time anyone knew, my dad had already moved with his family to Australia. I was actually supposed to be adopted by this rich family, with a doctor mom and lawyer dad. But the doctors said I was a boy, & that's what the adoptive parents expected. When I was born a girl they backed out, so my mom kept me rather than putting me into the system. 

My dad didn't even know I existed until I was 7yo. When he found out he came home and tried to meet me, but my mom wouldn't let him. I also had a really crappy home life. My step dad was an asshole and my parents were both abusive drug addict alcoholics. I hated them, and the first time I tried to run away I was only 7. I was beaten with a belt for that. The next time I ran away I was 11yo, and managed to stay away for 3 days. They found me, but I just kept running away and pretty quickly they stopped caring. I'd come home randomly, take a shower in my own bathroom, sleep in my own bed, get some clothes or whatever, then usually I'd steal some shit - money or alcohol or their meth stash, then leave again. 

At one point my aunt (Mom's sister) took me to meet my aunt on my dad's side. I spent a weekend with her and she took me bowling, to hang out with her friends, to drive around the mountains listening to music together. We had a great weekend and really bonded, and then 3 weeks later she committed suicide. ... The same way her brother had done years before, by >!Driving off the same cliff he did!<

So yeah... That sucked. I also met my uncle, who was 28 at the time. I was 14. I was a runaway, living on the streets, doing drugs, dropped out of school, sleeping in the woods in the snow, etc. So sometimes my uncle would come down from the mountains and bring me things - money, weed, meth, etc. Sometimes he'd take me camping with him, and I'd have somewhere warm to sleep for a night or 2. He lived with his parents/my grandparents, so he wasn't going to take me there, but he also had a camper so sometimes we'd go out into the woods and stay in it. 

One night we went camping, and we got really messed up. He gave me alcohol, weed, meth, shrooms, and whip-its. We were having a lot of fun, talking and laughing and stuff. Then he said we should go to bed. Which was weird, since we were high on meth and obviously not going to sleep. But we did anyway, we laid in the bed and I was just laying there wide awake, when he started touching me.... 

He raped me, and it was really confusing because I was so messed up on drugs that it felt good. It took me a long time to really come to terms with what happened. The next day he kept telling me how much he loves me and stuff. He was even making jokes about like, going on Jerry Springer and saying we love each other and are going to be together and we aren't ashamed. He took me to get a morning after pill, but that was when you had to have a prescription, so I didn't end up getting it. 

Like a month later is when I found out I was pregnant with my son........ I was so terrified that he was my uncle's. My uncle called me and said something like ""so, is he the ultimate [our last name]?""meaning like, is he our incest baby?🤢 It freaked me out so bad. I had a bf at the time too. I told him what happened and we got a DNA test done... Which sucked cuz back then if meant getting a massive fucking needle stuck through your belly into the amniotic fluid. God I was so scared of needles and it was one of the worst experiences of my life.

Thank God my son was my boyfriend's, not my uncle's. 

So, anyway... The reason I'm asking now is my uncle just got out of rehab, and he's moving back to Australia with my dad. I'm really close to my dad now btw. I love him so much. Meeting him was like... Finally figuring out who I am and why. He's literally just like me, or I guess I should say I'm just like him. He's awesome. We talk and text almost every day and we can talk about pretty much anything. 

..... But I don't know... I don't think I can tell him. The ONLY person I've ever told was my ex/my son's dad, and that's because I had to. Also that was years ago. My son is 19 now and I'm 36. But my dad just texted me about my Uncle moving there with him. I hate the idea of my uncle hanging out with and living off my dad without him knowing anything. IDK... IDK.... I don't know what I should do. Do I tell him? Will that just hurt him and cause unnecessary problems? I'm scared.... IDK man. I want to and I don't want to and I don't know what to do. 

I'm really sorry this was so long!!!! Thank you for reading"
282,1,"I'm a 21 years old male with high functioning autism and PTSD. I remember my mental health was much better in my kindergarten days before i went into middle school which is when the child abuse started, and i feel my PTSD has screwed me more than my autism.

I dropped out of school at the age of 14 because i went through five years of child abuse by school teachers. I was forced in special education at the age of 9 which only made things worse because the teachers abused me worse and i learned nothing. I think the middle school i went to has made my brain dumber and made me hate learning...

I had evidence of child abuse with pictures and voice recordings but my mom told me to ""get over it"" called these photos ""stupid"" and told me to be friends with the child abusing teacher that threatened to kill me with a knife and cut my head off. My mom said the teacher was ""just joking"" about these death threats because she thinks ""Why would a teacher do that?"" and I still hear voices of child abuse everyday...

I showed PTSD symptoms and i got suicidal at the age of 12. My brain still feels like it never developed past the age of 12 and i still feel suicidal today.

I was diagnosed with PTSD at the age of 19 and only got into therapy at the age of 21. I feel like i got therapy too late because i never did anything in my life, lost all motivation and went too far into escapism for 7 years after i dropped out of school."
283,2,"I just got diagnosed with PTSD literally a couple of days ago and it’s still processing in my brain right now. I almost feel guilty because I still don’t think that it was that bad, which I realize is a common symptom for others with the condition. Maybe I’m just uneducated about what PTSD really is? 

I know that my mother was not a good mom, very emotionally immature and just cold growing up. I don’t remember getting hugged very often from her or her teaching me how to do things, she told my sister to teach me how to shave my legs. She ended up leaving and moving away with her boyfriend 6 hours away from us when I was 13 and I didn’t talk to her or see her really until I was 16. I remember before she moved, she would stay some nights at her boyfriends house and left us home alone without any dinner and we had to fend for ourselves lots of nights. I remember her always being a workaholic and would come home from work then work some more when she got home, ignoring us. I was never the child she was proud of, she would rave about my sister to everyone then talk about me like an afterthought. I also remember a few years ago, now that she is back in the picture (I’m 24 now), ruining my plans to go to post-secondary school because she knew that I struggled in school my whole life and her first words were “you know it’s going to be hard, right?”

I know I have the symptoms, I avoid talking about or acknowledging my feelings about everything that happened and when I do it’s like I’m reliving everything all over again, I’m constantly on edge or very easily startled and I have insomnia, I have a lot of irritability and anger, my self esteem is nearly nonexistent. There are lots of gaps in my memory as well and I can be very emotionally distant, especially when I’m having hard feelings I shut down or hide so I can have my emotional outburst alone in peace where it’s safe. I also have abandonment issues, I crash out every time I think my boyfriend is mad at me (which I always think he’s mad at me when he’s not) 

Did anyone else experience the denial phase after being diagnosed? How long did it take you to overcome that feeling? Does the guilt or gaslighting your own emotions ever go away? "
284,2,"(Brief mention of SA and s***idality) 

I can't tell whether I'm being paranoid. 

I started making out with a new person, the first in years. 

Some history: my last job involved a girl who triangulated intensely against me, which resulted in my thinking anyone could be out to get me. The last guy I dated was a textbook narcissist. For example, he'd notice when I was having a good day and ruin it on purpose, and discard me only to pursue me again. One time I gave him a gift that he immediately threw away in front me. Before that, someone gave me a permanent and devastating std by not disclosing. Before that, I dated a mean drunk who'd tell me I was garbage a lot. I was SAed as a kid and my parents were in a miserable marriage, which made me suicidal by age 12. I've had boyfriends who treated me famously as well. 

I had a great night with the new guy, felt safe physically but like I didn't know him well enough to tell whether I can really trust him. At one point, I left the room for a couple minutes. 

The next morning, I opened one of my bags to see that the lining had ripped open. I just bought this bag and used it once. I'd been opening it to store things a few times a week, and it stayed new-looking until this morning after he'd been over. I'm pretty sure, anyway. I think I would have noticed if most of the lining had ripped. 

I had a panic attack about it and am unsure whether my worry is intuition or trauma fucking with my head. The bag was right next to where he was sitting, so it would have been easy for him to quickly do that, and I'm intimately familiar with how abusive people do little things like that (and tamper with property) to make you feel/look ""crazy"". 

Is he just a person in the world who triggers my issues, or is he dangerous? Idk. I guess if I'm worried about it, I should get away from him. 

So... any thoughts? If it wasn't him idk how that would have happened. "
285,0,"Hi everyone! I'm a doctoral student at Glasgow Caledonian University (and a clinical mental health counsellor) conducting a qualitative study exploring the experiences of people with PTSD who have used MDMA one or more times in different contexts--whether recreationally, self-guided, or with therapeutic support.

Please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions. I'd particularly love to hear from folks who have used MDMA recreationally, solo therapeutically, with a guide/sitter, or across more than one context. I really appreciate your time and interest!"
286,1,"I told my wife for the first time concretely that my brother raped me as a child. I don’t know how she feels that I didn’t tell her sooner, she tried to comfort me but didn’t say anything about it. I’ve been having a memory circling in my head so hard recently I couldn’t bury it any longer.

One night when I was 10-ish I woke up to my brother naked in my room, erect and doing things to me. He told me to go back to sleep so scarily that I just closed my eyes and don’t remember anything else. The next day I went downstairs while my mom was making breakfast and told her “X was in my room last night naked”, not really understanding what happened and thinking maybe he was sleepwalking, and she started screaming and crying at me and started waving the knife she was holding around at me, threatening me with it that I needed to “stop lying”. Brandishing it at me telling me to admit right then and there that it was a lie. So I did.

My mother died 5 years ago and I still don’t really know how to process never addressing it with her. She died a horrible death that I still feel at fault for and I still don’t know how to tackle the trauma from the abuse she facilitated and perpetrated herself while still feeling love. "
287,3,"I was recently diagnosed with ptsd (not my initial diagnosis). Some things happened now that triggered my childhood trauma and apart from projectile vomiting and shaking and not sleeping and behaving dangerously/destructively, i am extremely angry and i lash out. I realized that I have always been an angry person, ever since what was happening to me as a child and I never expressed it then, so now I'm left with years worth of anger that consumes me. I feel helpless, I can't control it, especially now that I'm forced to relive everything. I feel like I'm 10 times angrier than the average person, and my anger is way deeper i dont know how to explain. 
If you have ptsd, does it make you angrier/more irritable? If yes, how do you manage it?"
288,2,When i was 9 i think i remember going to the beach with my cousins and older brother. After the beach we had to wash off the sand and went to the shower and washed off with our swimsuits on. I then remember it feeling good when the water was hitting my part. I think i like pulled my waistband so there was an opening above and letting the water hit it. My cousin asked what was happening and i told him it feels good and then he did it too. Somehow i remember us like pushing up against each other and i was behind him. Im about a month older than him and we are good friends still and i have been wanting to apologize to him. Did i SA him?
289,1,"There were giant ziplocks full of bit coin i found in 1980, some kind of gold coin, i neglected to examine the ones stained from when i poured pvc primer on then when i first saw them. That much money, that much control. Phoney family was of no help, i couldve shot myself numerous times. FmL homeless and hopeless "
290,2,"As the title says, how do you guys cope with a fire/smoke alarm going off? I, like many others with PTSD, am absolutely petrified of it. Hearing the shrill alarm, even if it only rings out once and I know it was a fluke, sends me into instant blinding panic. It makes me irrationally afraid, and in the aftermath I’ll struggle to relax, let my guard down and even sleep when I’m aware there’s an alarm nearby. 

Obviously, alarms like these are life saving and I don’t want to get rid of them. But I would appreciate some advice on how to cope with them better."
291,0,"I'm autistic. I squee at every cow. I love cows. So much.

I also have very bad cPTSD and my donkey is my disability assistance animal. She helps me so much. 

Here is a quote from my earlier posts about donkeys and how they can help (c)PTSD:

"" So much of donkey time is about reassuring each other that you are safe. Helping a donkey feel safer and trusting, which will help you feel safer. Then, when you are both assured you are safe, you will be rewarded with so much love, affection, joy, trust, hugs, licks, weight therapy as they love to put their head on your shoulder/lap (depending on their height) for hug snuggle time, and more. 

They also live a very long time. 25-30 is normal. 30-35 is reachable with good care and some luck. Some donkeys live even longer; up to 65 years! So, every time you are with the donkey, it will get better as they will always be trusting more and more, and bond tightly. 

When you first meet most donkeys--unless they were trained/spoiled by many people such as at a large multi-voulenteer rescue or petting zoo--they won't trust you at all. Carrot won't. She knows four people now, and all of us had to work with her slowly. 

Carrot won't approach you as a stranger except to reach very cautiously for a cookie with me standing nearby. Then she'll run away eight feet and watch you. For an hour. The best thing you could do is bring a book (not your cell phone: Carrot is very envious of cell phones and gets pissed off at me if I am on my phone for long texts around her. I approve of this,) 

Slowly, she'll accept more treats. She can only have so many.

After a few hours, you can scratch her ass some. Maybe brush her, but primarily her ass so she is primed to run away. Also she likes her ass scratched a lot, ha, she can't reach it herself. (She does have a scratching post!) 

After a couple of months of reassuring her that she is safe with you, she will be resting her head in your lap. Trusting you. Thanking you for the peace. Wanting you to feel safe, too.

Even from the start you have to work on how you express your cPTSD symptoms around her. If you act like you are in danger, she will think she is in danger. Not necessarily from you, but from whatever it is that is scaring you. It is OK; when you are with a donkey, your attention has to be on them. She will help keep your focus more on how she feels than what you are sadly having to go through. Before you know it, while you are with her, your symptoms will be more background static. Her feeling safe while you are with her will start to rub off on you.

It is no cure. There is no cure. 

But, it is the best therapy I have ever found for my cPTSD symptoms. 

I get to feel safe. Even for brief moments. 

It... feeling safe... it is really something.""



Cow poop is splattery and more icky; harder for me to clean up. It could mess itself in every truck ride.

I have a nonprofit where I dream of helping people with autism and/or depression/anxiety/agoraphobia/(c)PTSD/in hospice care pet cows. I am doing this out of the cost of my own pocket to get it started. It is my first dream beyond having my basic needs met.

But cows are harder to transport, because poop. They also don't live as long as donkeys; that'd break everyone's hearts and it would mean retraining another cow more often. 

Mini cows are too inbred... I know that now. I can't morally do that. Maybe a dexter; but the donkey would still be smaller. Also, mini donkeys evolved naturally to be small in their environment. 

Donkeys are easier to take to people for love therapy.

  


Pros for donkey over cow:

Live longer.

Healthier DNA.

Very easy to clean poo (round, solid bits, and donkeys only poo in carefully selected areas \[I.E: this tight corner sucks to run in. I will make it a toilet\]). I could easily bring some straw and a bag for every trip and be dandy. There'd be no splattery poo left on the grass. I likely wouldn't even need to train the donkey to poop only on the straw; they'd prefer it. They might even get mad at me if I didn't bring straw for their potties! Especially when they pee; they do not want to be splattered on!

Smaller. They'll fit in the back of our crew cab and/or I can modify the truck bed into a very safe and comfy spot for them. We can also more easily pick up a donkey than a cow.

Donkeys give hugs. They put their head on your shoulder/lap (depending on how tall they are) and gently hold you. They do this naturally with other donkeys. It means they trust you, love you, and feel safe with you. These hugs can last minutes to an hour. Most of the time, it's about 10-15 minutes. I have a mental spreadsheet that I collect data on for no reason. They're great hugs.

They think first, act after. No accidental steps, no running in a panic from snakes. 

Their intelligence makes them easy to train to do complex things.

No dangerous horns that can wack at you when they react to a fly.

Donkeys LOVE kissies from their friends. They absolutely love them. They'll push their fuzzy nose against you and wiggle their fuzzy lip against your face. Sometimes with a little too much weight behind it, because they love you so much. 

Donkeys form friendships. They get to know you as an individual. They'll remember you specifically to a higher degree than a cow, because of the whole stubborn/thinking first thing. They'll bray in joy to see their friends if they've missed you and it isn't raining. A donkey can get to know tens of thousands of people as individuals.

They live a long, long time. 30-35 is normal. Some live up to 65! 

  
Cons:

They won't drool on you like a cow. Cow drool isn't icky to me, despite my sensory issues. It's love drool. 

They don't have that... face ... that my autism likes.

They're not cows.

They think first, act after. They don't have that amazing derp that cows have. They don't melt in joy from a hug that you initiate; they want to be the ones to decide they trust you and love you enough to hug you. 

They, until trained to, don't trust strangers at all. I can train a donkey to trust strangers 80% of the way, but they will always make their own decisions and get to know everyone for who they are. Cows are easier. I could train a cow to love every single person on the planet without thinking first. I can say, here, cuddle this person, and the cow would. Meanwhile, the donkey will still want a minute or two to look at you and think before it comes up to you.

Cows feel safe easily. They just feel safe, because they are. Done deal. Some might say that cows can be better for PTSD in this way.

Some of these pros and cons are double sided and go both ways.



Neutrals:

It would still be a fluffy donkey or highland cow. They're very brushable.

Still a farm animal.



My PTSD draws me towards donkeys, but my autism draws me towards cows.



What do you think, fellow folks with (c)PTSD? Would you be OK petting a cow instead of a donkey? I really want to do a cow with all my autistic heart... ... ... but logic and my PTSD brain says a donkey would be better.

Um. 

Thank you.

296,2,"i had an accident on the last sunday, it was kinda my mistake as i had momentarily not kept my eye on the road and my car rammed into another. thankfully me as well as the other car inhabitants were unharmed and the worst was that both our cars got badly damaged. we also evaded any legal problems and mutually had an understanding with some monetary exchange. anyway the thing is before the incident i used to keep a daily journal of sorts, writing down highlights of the day religiously for a while but now after the incident, i dont feel like writing about those days and what happened, maybe im just trying not to relive it and avoid it but is it healthy. i have managed to write here, maybe i should push through there as well"
297,2,"i was 13 when i was sexually assaulted by my bf at the time and it doesn't feel like it'll get better. it's not fair that i have to go through highschool with 5 different mental illnesses because of mean people's actions that were out of my control. ptsd and anxiety are probably my worst ones because i share 3 classes with my ex, and in my history class we do group projects a LOT. my therapist doesn't really get it. she just tells me its normal to feel this way but doesn't tell me what to do about how i frel. i want to get better. i dont want to hurt myself. i used sh as a way to keep off ""predators"" like how catipillers are neon to keep off predators. i just dont know what to do. does it get better?"
298,1,"Im 20F and my house was broken into about one year ago (1 year + a few weeks) by my ex-boyfriend, and I have been on a painful journey since.

Many of you can probably relate to the struggle to see yourself through every moment. I have been more tired in this past year than I have been in my entire life. As a college student pursuing two degrees, I dedicated every ounce of my time to schoolwork or resting. Recently, I have gotten myself into TV and media analysis, which was a big hobby for me before the break-in, but it's not the same. I have tried other things. Art, running, video games, music, everything that I was into before the break-in, but I do not feel fulfilled. I miss the feeling of actively having something in my hands. I miss having interests that I could find joy in, research, and show off. I feel like I'm still without a personality, and I feel like a loser.

Does anyone here have a hobby that I can easily integrate into? Or any other advice in general. I have been fighting this mostly uneducated, except for reading through The Body Keeps The Score. I am medicated on Wellbutrin and recently started Ritalin as well, but I am only supposed to take it on an as-needed basis. I have a great support system. I feel safe enough to be comfortable in my skin again, I just need something to do while I inhabit it."
299,2,"Hey everyone, I’m dealing with some ptsd and survivors’ guilt from something that happened in March. Details provided upon request (within the allowable rules of course), I don’t mind at all. I didn’t exactly realize I was dealing with this until somebody pointed it out to me over the weekend. I have not been diagnosed by a professional and I am actively seeking that, but I don’t also think I necessarily need to. More for closure I guess.

Anyways, I noticed that I was acting out a lot on a lot of people near me and I kept spiraling into these guilt circles even though it wasn’t directly relating to the traumatic event I went through. I guess my question is whether or not this is something that can happen? I have my own coping methods that I use to help myself heal, and I have used in the past, but I’ve never had a sort of disconnect between the event and how I’m acting out in regards to other people, even those closest to me. The feeling of guilt is the same but I feel when I’m trying to make good decisions I just end up in this disorganized thought process and I start spiraling and it’s not good. Especially when I prefer to live a life of service to others, as that’s what gives me fulfillment in life, I’m sure you can see why this is troubling. Please let me know if anyone has dealt with this before and if there’s anything that worked for you that I could explore. Thank you :)"
300,2,"Hi all, I work events, mainly weddings where there are dj's etc controlling the music. There's a specific party song as it were that i find really triggering and as soon as I hear it I typically cry and/or start to have a panic attack. Up until this point I have successfully not listened to it however now I don't really have a choice and I need ways to manage when it does. Does anyone have any recommendations ?"
301,2,"I'll keep this short, I hate talking about it.  I start crying thinking about it. I don't know why I cry.  I was diagnosed with PTSD in 2009, for one issue( over it, mostly) , then diagnosed again with PTSD in 2016(current problem), and diagnosed in 2023 (same one from 2016), this is about that one.

I can drive. I don't drive, but I need to drive to survive out here. My whole life depends on getting over this. I need to get over it.

Nearly a decade ago, I was driving with my father and the brakes went out on our car while we were on the Cross Bronx Expressway.  Somehow,  I don't know. Maybe I used all my luck that day. We hit nothing but clipped a fire hydrant ( no damage)  and the wall in the parking lot (bumper damage), I should have been excited but ever since I just feel dread. My dad, he's apparently been through worse driving in the past, he doesn't like me driving him.

 Everyone tells me how lucky I am.

I don't feel lucky, in fact. Since that day, it feels like everything I attempt to do fails. Like all of my luck was used up surviving that.  I feel cold and afraid every-time I think about driving.  I can drive, I can make myself . I can swallow the fear most day and get behind the wheel, but this is really ruining my life.

I've been to three, four different therapists and it's always the same thing. You can get over it when you can, or when you need to. It's been almost 10 years to the date and I'm not over it. I can't cope, I can't rationalize. Everyone tells me to just get over it and grow up. I can't believe every car is unsafe. I don't. It's like something is touching me every time I think about it and pulling it to the forefront of my thoughts whenever it's time to drive, no matter how hard I try not to remember.

302,0,"We have been together for over two years and she really is an amazing person. I understand that her anger, lack of impulse control, jealousy, desire to maintain control are all part of her who she is as a result of her trauma. The trauma is intense and stems from adolescence to early adulthood. I’m reading books on PTSD, just trying to understand what she’s going through, if I can in some way. I’d like to help and I feel that just listening to her discuss her day and her abbreviated mention of the therapy sessions is kind of beneficial to her. I don’t ask about the sessions but I listen if she wants to discuss. She’s explained to me that no matter how much I try, I will never fully understand her and this brings me to my question. I know there is a “wall” that she has built to protect her. I know this wall is there because I can almost touch it, it feels like. Her therapist knows it’s there because he’s told her as much. I believe this wall is a way to protect her from harm and doesn’t allow anyone to get too close. Although, she has a tendency to talk about ex’s, which I don’t like, but she stops short of being open about what ended these relationships. My view is that these past relationships ended because she chose to end them because they got too close or perhaps these men couldn’t take the aforementioned behavior issue, like the anger. For whatever reason, I have endured the everything she’s thrown at me (metaphorical) and we are together. We are on our 3rd couples counselor and it feels like we are actually improving now but I need to see follow-through for me to fully trust that we are aligned. Back to my question….do you have any advice on how I can bring this wall of hers down, partly or fully?"
303,0,"Hello. First of all, I'd like to thank you for reading this post. I can't express how grateful I am to be able to share this community with everyone here. I just wanted to take my time to let everyone know that their struggles are not exclusive. Everyone goes through hard times and rough times. We all need each other and need support for one another to be able to help one another.

As a man who's suffered from a few mental health issues myself such as depression and sometimes anxiety, I know how tough and hard it can be. I can just say, you're not alone.

I once sat there in my room thinking about what I can do to help others especially those are going through hardships and then I realized that many like to use outlets to be able to help cope with their issues. I figured, there'd be a great way to make coping fun, interesting, and fun. Not something that can temporarily numb the pain, but give a joyous outlet to cope with it.

This is why I came up with WS Publishing (Wellsprings Publishing). The aim of my company is to be able to create products which will help people in various mental health issues. There are many who undergo many types of issues such as depression (like myself), anxiety, PTSD, and more. I thought to myself, what would be a good way to deal with this issues? Then I thought-poetry, puzzles, cards. They're great ways to alleviate these issues.

Here at WS Publishing, we don't just make books, puzzles, or cards. We make books, puzzles, and cards with the intention of giving outlet to people for stress relief.

Right now, we came up nurtured puzzles and therapeutic puzzles. Nurtured are supposed to give you ease with familiarity while therapeutic is supposed to give you a solution. We integrate mandala patterns to be able to deal with these issues that addresses things like PTSD, anxiety, depression, and more.

My aim isn't to just make another publishing company. My aim is to create an outlet for people to find peace.

304,1,"You know it’s funny no matter how much you explain something to others they just will never understand the severity of your experiences and how it’s shaped you as a person. My sister and I weren’t caretakers for like a month and then my mother got better. She never got better this happened for years as I was a child and teen. This started happening when I was in elementary up until she died when I was 15.  She was in and out of the hospital for years. Until she ended up in a nursing home for “rehabilitation” doctors recommendations. They couldn’t help at all due to her weight. Then we get a call one morning saying she passed away from a heart attack. 

I remember the times she took one wrong step  and fell. My sister and I trying our best to help her up and just couldn’t we felt so useless and would ultimately have to call an ambulance or my uncle to help her up. She would get abscesses all over her body from being diabetic , and had a nurse that would visit to change dressings on wounds. My sister ended up learning how to do it in between visits. 

I remember when she would become upset with us when we wouldn’t bring her certain foods because we wanted her to eat healthier. 

I remember telling her that I wish I could do the things that my friends do with theirs mom with her . She started crying .I thought to myself I should never say anything like that again. I never wanted to hurt her feelings or make her feel less than. I just wanted to do more with her. 

I remember when her friends would come over and she would sell her medicine to them for money to pay bills because she was on disability and that money was never enough. Sometimes it was the other way around where she would give them money for more medicine. Because I remember her crying in doctors appointments about how much pain she was in and then she would stop crying when the doctors walked away. Because maybe she didn’t think they took her pain serious unless she cried I don’t know.

I remember when a friend of hers came over and stole my PlayStation before they left because they were so high “they didn’t know what they were doing.” I mean barely shut the door on there way out. But they returned it the next day and apologized and I didn’t hate them I didn’t think they were a bad person just thought they were struggling a lot and I normalized it. 

I remember her gushing over and making sexual comments about the idols that I liked at the time. I thought it was embarrassing but a way of her trying to bond with me or something. I think she was lonely. She did a lot for others provided our home to them. But they always took more than what they gave. 

I remember her helping my sister’s friend at the time catfish her boyfriend. My sisters friend thought her boyfriend was interested in other girls. Let’s call her B So with B’s permission of course my mom pretended to be another girl to catch b’s boyfriend cheating. The guy came to our house expecting the girl that he had been cheating on B with to be there and Instead it was my mom, sister , B , myself , and our cousin there. Again it was funny at the time but I realize now how inappropriate that was for my mom to do that. 

I remember being like 10 and seeing my sister throw up medicine from an overdose on meds . Because “Nothing I ever do is good enough.” 

I remember me doing the same thing at the age of 14 because things had gotten worse and I knew they were never going to get better. 


My mom was the first dead person I ever saw. I’m not sure if it’s a good or bad thing that we went to see her that day. Because the image of her haunts my brain. It was only in recent years and I mean maybe last year that I thought about anything past seeing her body as trauma and then I realized all these things that happened when she was alive that I have a better understanding of now as an adult because I normalized them for so long. 

I still love my mom  I still don’t want to live without her .I still think she had good qualities I’m sure I have some of her good and bad qualities my mom was not a bad person! But that doesn’t change that those experiences impacted me a lot and shaped as a person. "
305,2,"4 years ago, my ex got sick in the pandemic. He declined rapidly, died within 10 or so days.   
My actual boyfriend got sick with the flu, the same day my ex got diagnosed with COVID.   
He has a fever that keeps coming back (very low fever, my ex had a very high fever), and I'm panicking, checking his temps all the time (doesn't help that I have OCD too)  
And I remember, I promised my ex I'd make him pasta from the scratch, the sauce too, when he got better. He never got better.  
I promised my boyfriend I'd make him hot chocolate from the scratch when he got better. And it fucking clicked. My GOD.   
My brain just switched into flight mode and I went ""What's the point of making it for him? What if he never gets better? What if he dies too? What's the point?"" UGH.  
And I'm here dwelling on the ""what if"", can't stop thinking about it, and I hate it. I hate every little bit of it. "

Hi, fellow survivor Danny here- a few of yall might recognize me now. The one who was kidnapped by abusive and criminal narcissists, twice, once at fifteen and again at sixteen. Only part of my 18 years of literal torture. And yet I still survived.



Since the hypervigilance never shuts off: that's my personal answer. I use it. It keeps me working and getting done what needs to be done (albeit it is not fun).



What do you do?

309,1,"The TW is just for rape mention but I couldn't figure out how to edit the flair, sorry. Anyway, onto my post.

I cannot believe that for 7 long years I considered this to be rape. It was my first sexual encounter, I was 14, he was 14. We were young and dumb. It happens. It wasn't long, it wasn't violent. I'm so selfish and stupid for ever thinking this could be trauma. It's not trauma.

I need to grow up and own up to it all. I'm 22 now. People in this world, women especially, go through SO much worse. I'm part of some coping groups that I will be leaving because it's all so much worse. I don't need coping groups. I was old enough, not a child, like I said wasn't violent or bloody or anything. I wasn't trafficked or abused multiple times.

Sure I don't remember my childhood and sure I became disabled from this ""incident"" I guess we'll call it but really that doesn't matter. It's really only a hypothesis that this incident and my disability are related, we'll never know for sure.

I also can't believe that I manipulated my therapist into a PTSD diagnosis. It really wasn't bad enough to warrant all that. I'm sorry to my therapist that I convinced you I was traumatized. I'll probably send her an email later saying exactly this, I probably still have it somewhere.

To anyone out there that I may have offended by referring to my first sexual encounter as rape, I am so sincerely sorry. I have learned and changed as a person. I will be investigating how to remove PTSD from my medical documents and throwing away all my therapy notes/assignments/vent art, unless there's somewhere I can bring it where it'll actually be useful. 

Thank you for reading and please I don't want any sympathy in the comments. I did something bad and I'm trying to own up to it now."
310,3,"M46, mil retiree. My care team is calling it a disassociation episode, I’m not sure what happened. I do know nothing remotely close to it has ever happened to me before. After a moderately stressful day I consumed some THC (semi-routine habit for stress management and chronic pain. I sat down to decompress (as is my normal process following stressful night meetings). I was in a great headspace at first, and then everything went bad. I was convinced the world was ending and I had the chance to stop it but I was too selfish. My first disassociation led to a lot of other firsts, such as being detained, being beaten and tazed, being booked and getting to spend a night in jail. I can’t say I’m chomping at the bit to try again, however I felt like I was on the cusp of some amazing discovery about myself right before things went sideways. I remember feeling like the most worthless person in the world. I can’t stop thinking about my mental state right before the dissociation. It was terrifying but also bordered on euphoric. My first priority is doing everything I can to make sure the breakdown doesn’t happen again, but besides a lot of bruising, possibly a couple sprained joints, and my first ever arrest; I came away from this desperate to figure out what was I so close to figuring out right before it went sideways. I’m being sent to “somewhere safe” for a while but I’d like to keep exploring that that edge of sanity or whatever and see if I can discover what my superego and/or ID was trying to tell me. Any suggestions or related experiences would be awesome. "
311,2,Like. I was cuddling with my boyfriend for a bit while watching tv. And he was touching me and petting me like normal. Nothing explicit or that kind of way. But now half an hour later I feel dirty where he touched me. He has NEVER hurt me. I’ve never felt dirty from him before and I don’t want to feel dirty because of him when he did nothing wrong. I was SA’d 13 days ago by a stranger. I’m just really irritated and frustrated by this because I didn’t expect that even safe touch would feel bad.
312,3,"Need a bit of help through this. I think I’m having an episode of prolonged derealisation and dissociation. Have been triggered over an over this week and been chronically stressed by my living situation. I think I am leaving my body, and detaching from it, and it’s absolutely terrifying. I’m not sure how to come out of it. I also feel like I don’t know who I am, what I like, what I want. I feel extremely on edge..I’m aware of what’s real and what’s not, but I feel like my brain is slipping out because it’s just too distressing to be where I am. It doesn’t feel real yet I know it is and that distresses me. Usually changing environments does help when I’m like this..but I’m a bit stuck and cannot talk to my family about this. I think I need support to leave, it’s got too much. "
313,1,"
I want to start this post off by saying I know my trauma is “lesser” compared to the more evil crimes in life, like rape or suicide attempts. Think what you want about my story, I don’t care. 

I’ll be discussing gruesome animal death obviously, so don’t read if you are sensitive to that. 

My parents have always neglected the animals we had growing up, and continue to do so. Of course, when I was little, I didn’t know how they were being treated was “wrong”. All I knew was that nobody else in the home seemed to care about our animals except me. 

We had countless cats growing up. I can’t even begin to try and recollect how many, only that it was an endless cycle of kittens. They all lived outdoors, usually staying in our garage or shed. 

One of my earliest memories is climbing up our shed ladder to check on the seven black kittens that had been recently born, only to find that they were all dead. 

That never bothered me then. They died, it was normal. When our dogs would run off and get hit by cars, that was fine, too, because it was just a natural accident. 

My dad “dropped off” our childhood dog Snickers one day when I was in 4th grade. Told me he let him go in some nice neighborhood for some other family to take care of him. He also told me never to tell the animal shelter people about that, or else we wouldn’t get to adopt any more pets. So I didn’t. 

Time goes on, more kittens are born, more adult cats wander into the woods and never come back. My cat Dobby, Pixie, Autumn. I raised them as kittens and loved them so much but all of them eventually were let outside and never seen again. It was fine, it was normal. No big deal. 

When I was maybe 15 I got my cat Moxxie from a neighbor. She got pregnant with kittens - I helped her give birth in my room, since nobody else was there. Eventually we got them all homes. It was fine. 

She got pregnant again, this time with 4 orange kittens. I helped her give birth in my room again, since nobody else was willing. Eventually we got them all homes, except one. 

I fell in love with her kitten I named Little Chunky, who I begged my dad to let live indoors so I knew he’d be safe. My dad agreed at first, but then changed his mind a week later. Little Chunky was kicked out into the garage. 

I told myself it would be fine, he would fine. Well, surprise, he wasn’t. The literal very next day, after I got home from school, I came home to Little Chunky dragging himself in the garage with a broken spine, back legs, and tail. 

I felt a sense of horror. It was because in that moment, I knew nobody would care but me, and I knew I was staring death in the face. Little Chunky couldn’t live on like that, and it was now my duty to end his suffering. 

I remember sitting down on the garage steps and just crying and crying and crying. Harder than I ever cried before. Because I knew what I had to do and I didn’t want to have to be in that situation. Why did he have to be injured? Why did I have to deal with it? At all? 

My parents refused to take him to a vet. In a sort of blind hope I kept him in my brothers bathroom for 3 days, hoping he would get better, but obviously he didn’t. 

I took it upon myself to drive him to the emergency vet, where they refused me service since I was 17. I felt angry - here I was, trying to end my pets suffering, and I was being refused even that. 

My mom eventually came to the clinic and we put Little Chunky down. I didn’t watch the euthanasia because I was selfish. All I did was accept the body bag and drive back home to bury him. 

If only it was that simple. I held a little “funeral service” (candles lighting) and dug the hole and buried him. 

A few days later, I got home from school. I was in a good mood and decided to go outside in the nice spring weather to walk around the yard. After I walked for a while, I noticed a strange lump in the yard. I thought it was a piece of trash, a cloth, a rabbit, anything. As I walked closer to it, it was like my brain refused to process what it was staring directly at. 

Eventually I realized I was staring at my dead cat’s decomposing body on the ground. My dogs had dug it out of its grave and tore it out of his body bag, and now it was laying in the yard. 

I remember turning around and just walking back inside. What else could I have done, lol? 

I had chronic nightmares for the next 3 years after that. I had some other traumatic things happen, but I think it was mostly these moments that caused it, and for good reason. 

When I say chronic nightmares, I mean like the legit documented kind. Every single month, I would tally how many days of the month I had nightmares, and for 3 years it was, on average, 50%. That meant for 3 years I was having nightmares 15/30 of the days. It was an endless cycle and no medications helped. 

I think they were based on this particular trauma because I never felt a sense of despair and horror as intense as those memories. 

It’s like my brain just couldn’t get over that slow, agonizing realization of what I was looking at and everything that it meant. I had so many nightmares with that same exact scenario - me slowly realizing something terrible, awful had happened. And having to deal with it, try to figure out a solution, but I couldn’t. I just had to accept the pain and horror. 

I work at a cat animal shelter now, and when I told my coworkers my story they all agreed it was horrific. I was shocked to find none of them could relate. For a long time I was haunted by the horror I felt while working there; every time I found a dead cat or kitten, it was like I was reminded of that day. 

My parents still neglect their animals, but now it’s just down to two dogs. They need groomed badly, since they’re covered with mats (that haven’t been dealt with their whole lives). I tried to book them grooming appointments but they werent ever trained to ride in a car or handle a leash so I could never get them inside the building. Our town has no “at home” groomers either. 

Once again I feel this sense of dooming responsibility to end their suffering. You think it’s be easy to just shave off their mats but it’s harder than it looks with mats as bad as theirs, and not to mention they’re terrified of the machine. 

To be honest, I’ve been ignoring the dogs ever since the grooming appointment fail. It’s easier to let them suffer than to take on the responsibility and the pain that comes with it. I can only hope that eventually I’ll get the motivation to do something. 

Anyways that’s my vent :3 bye

314,2,"I just feel the need to get this off my chest. Today at the pool, we were playing around. Im a teenage boy so me and my group kept splashing and picking up and just playing in the pool. Eventually, I got rushed by my group and it was fun at first until one of them had me in a chokehold underwater and they kept pushing me down and down. I almost drowned and afterwards, I sat outside and thought for a bit then left. What should I do?"
315,0,"Two years ago I (32M) had 3 heart attacks in a short period of time and then a month long deep coma. I somehow survived a drug overdose that could have killed 3 people. Doctors don't really know how to treat me because nobody has survived what I did. After a recovery period, all of my mental faculties are back, but my body will probably never fully recover.
 
After I recovered fully, it was pretty clear that I am not the same person. However, I think I am better than I was before. Now I have an unquenchable thirst for philosophy and science. I study in my free time now. I'm always searching for answers to the big questions in life. Before, I couldn't care less. Now I'm passionate. I also write much more and much better than I used to. I have a richer sense of creativity and have become more articulate. I even wrote an actual book. 

Another profound change in me is a sense of zen, acceptance, and mindfulness. I'm no longer angry. I'm more self-aware and empathetic. I love people more deeply than I ever have. I feel things incredibly deeply, but also have the ability to tame the feelings. I'm grateful for having experienced death and am not afraid anymore. 

Could this change be the result of some kind of brain trauma? But what kind of trauma makes you better?"
316,2,"I (f,14) was groomed, emotionally manipulated and guilt tripped into kink by a guy 2 years older me a few months ago (all without rape, thankfully). He was telling me he‘s gonna kill himself is I left him, he isolated me from my friends and he forced me to pull him on his necklace as if he was a dog while calling me “mommy”. 

The two of us used to go trough a tunnel that lead from our school trough a bus station while singing “Loser Baby” by Keith David and Blake Roman. Everytime I go trough that tunnel or hear that song I remember him. I even remember him knowing I will go trough that tunnel. I also always used to tell him “what cha staring at” when he was looking at me slightly romantically. Now everytime someone tells me that I remember him and feel sick - as if I’m gonna trough up even if I haven’t eaten anything. A few days ago I saw him and his new girlfriend in a libary and ran away without thinking much and today when we were walking trough the same hallway I was trying my best to calm myself down and think about something else. 

Does that sound like PTSD? Should I talk to my therapist about it and get a diagnosis? I was also diagnosed with a depressive adjustment disorder so maybe It's just all part of that and not PTSD."
317,3,"As I sit here and dwell on my thoughts, my body feels pain and my chest feels tight, my airways constricting with overwhelming fear, my head spins and and migraines worsen, I overwhelm myself with to much esoteric knowledge and trying to understand concepts not meant to be understood, I overwhelm myself by how many views I get with my music cause I'm not use to attention and hate it, my neurons are firing off all my physical senses for no reason other then pattern recognition i remind myself,  but the pain does not subside, it worsens, the physical pain that is associated with anxiety is something idk how to get over, I often confuse it with real pain that shouldn't be overlooked. Well I'm gonna play apex legends, I'm a absolute beast on there lol "
318,1,"I’m pretty annoyed by this still, I feel misunderstood. I told her how there are a lot of things that I didn’t get to do with my mom. Even the things I did do just wasn’t the same because I didn’t do them with my mom. Like my first concert. My uncles girlfriend at the time took me instead of my mom . My mom was severely obese which caused her many help problems plus a twisted knee cap which at some point during my childhood she stayed in her bed and or sat in her chair. So also severely depressed. So yes as a child I was extremely frustrated by the fact that I had a living parent in my home that I could not do simple things with like go to the movie theater because who was going to drive us and if we got there she wouldn’t be able to walk the distance . If that wasn’t enough I became a caretaker at a younger age . If that’s not enough was exposed to things like a friend of hers “accidentally” stealing my PlayStation (it was returned.) . But still yes I would have liked for my mom to have attended my elementary graduation, my middle school graduation , my high school graduation. I would have liked to go to culture night at school with my mom instead of my uncles girlfriend. “Well some people have parents that are able bodied and still didn’t show up.” Okay what’s your fucking point it still sucks is that supposed to make me feel better? Then those who do only show up to pretend like they’ve been there the whole time through all your suffering. Suffering that they could’ve helped prevent or at least offer support a listening ear . So no I don’t care if my uncle and others showed up to my high school graduation because where were they when I went into foster care when I tried to kill myself. As a child hated doing things for others being helpful is one thing but as a requirement as a responsibility no I hated it because who was taking care of me my sister experienced at least 8 years of being spoiled by my mom , grandmother , great grandmother. Then I come around and cause my mom to have health problems . But I’m entitled “did you get everything you wanted as a child.” I’ve been coming to you for over a year now if you haven’t picked up on the fact that I went without a lot as a child by now who have I been talking to. I didn’t want materialistic things I wanted to spend quality time with my mom I wanted to do the things that I saw my friends do with their parents. I’m upset that she allowed herself to get like that and now I’ve developed at this point probably an eating disorder that I disguise as “fasting for health “when I literally go 20+ hours without eating and even 90 hours once because I never want to get to her numbers. Because I’m so traumatized by her life. No hobbies no job , no love interest, not able to maintain relationships due to health problems , single mom She died at 48. Which I don’t care if I do but I don’t want it to be from weight. "
319,2,"I can't remember my childhood.
And I'm scared what I'll find out if I go looking for her. Idk if it's because the constant fights whit my parents and sister I have since I can remember,the 14 years of therapy I went , repressed trauma,the fact that for a decade now I have heard my parents and sister say that  I used to be the most eloquent smart kid ever and that I'm no longer am , hearing them askim what happened to that boy,that I have stopped evolving,That I regressed or a combination of all but I can't remember anything from my childhood.
I know for a fact that the first few years of my life were passed in and out of the hospital and the rest of the years until I was almost adult were spent in and out of therapy,but without being that info I can't remember anything. I'm 19 years old and I decided that this summer I'll check my childhood photos and videos out for the first time since they were taken almost 20 years ago.i haven't checked them ever cuz they are in hard drives which makes it a pain in the ass to see. and I'm scared of what I'll find and learn. Will I figure out what happened to that boy I used to be,will I find out why I can't remember anything about my childhood why I am the way I am. Will I finally understand myself better and learn and see what has been missing from myself all of this years?
All this questions and more scare me of checking cuz what if I don't like what I found and learn ?
What should I do?"
320,2,"I’m a writer. I used to make movies, and now I can’t even watch a simple episode of FBI or let alone freaking finding nemo without being reminded. Anything that involves misunderstandings or accusations will  make me go nuts. I just want to mark it stop "
321,1,"So for pretext I was abused by stepfather for 10 years. As were siblings. Abuse ranged from torture, assault and sexual charges.
When I was 15 the court case got started. Im 30 now. So he has been in prison just over 14 years now. 
I see so how many posts about how people couldn't get charges against the abuser or how they can never disclose or prove what happened.
Im so grateful for the outcome we got. But I feel so guilty that we were able to and others weren't.
Like why did we deserve the resolution and others didnt."
322,2,"Ive been having some weird mental effects these last few days and im not really sure if thier normal? Last Friday I was in a motercyle accident that in all seriousness should have killed me. I was tboned by a Ford escape going 60 mph and somehow walked away with almost nothing but a shattered elbow. Ever since then left hand turns have been really difficult to commit to just driving my car, and anytime I see another guy on a bike all i see is, a guy, not on a bike...

However Ive been having these really weird surreal thoughts about life without me. The realization that life would just go on without me, is somehow terrifying but also extremely comforting. I feel like I'd be forgotten (I know i wouldnt be), but at the same time I know everyone i love will be ok. Are these kinda thoughts normal after such a traumatic event? Or should I book another therapy appointment 😅"
323,3,"I'm trying to untie this knot of beliefs around my trauma. It kind of feels like I can't have basic acceptance in my life or it'll be like I'm saying ""it's ok"". Yeah all these horrible things happened but it's ok and I'm moving on. Meanwhile my trauma is a part of why I'm chronically ill as an adult and have lost so much of my life, like I try to build something different and then my genes trigger and poof it all collapses and I'm back in a position of depending on people for help.   
Maybe the whole reason I'm mixing up acceptance with excuses is just because hyper vigilance feels like safety, which means I'm ready now. I'm ready to identify what's not ok and fight it!!!

People act like acceptance is serene, but does it look more like self righteous anger and determination? Does it look more like thriving in spite of who tried to stop you or k\*\*\* you? 

But acceptance also means saying, they did it, I'm sick and I'm eating a bowl of misery because yall literally changed the make up of my brain. Accepting the things I can not change feels like saying they're ok, when it's not. It's wrong, and it's fucked up, and I am barely surviving it.

And for that reason I can't get rid of this critical voice in my head, I can't praise myself for any progress I make, I have to judge myself for having so little and being so disabled.

Like ok... I can't accept anything, I have to constantly judge myself, I can't acknowledge any progress because it's not good enough. I can't show myself any kindness, I can't say it's ok to be where you are. I can't accept the things I can not change because that would be like saying it's ok that it's like this!!! I have to resist!!!

And obviously... that is not a helpful position.

  
What does acceptance look like for y'all when so many bad things happened, esp if you're not in a good place?"
324,1,"It's been nine years since the 'big event' happened to me. Since then, I feel like some parts of my brain just snapped. It feels like I'm not as good as I should be while performing day to day tasks or working. It really makes me feel as if I'm having neurological issues due to the mental tax 'it' caused me and it's getting worse. I'm hoping I'm not alone. I'm sorry that I probably didn't explain it well enough. I really want to get a scan of my brain, but in this economy where relatively decent health insurance still can't cover crazy costs, it won't be anytime soon. "
325,2,"(Specifically for rape trauma)

I’m curious to see if anyone else experiences the insomnia, sensation of the body shutting down when confronted with the tiniest trigger, and tight jaw / TMJ. There are other things I feel also. I hope I’m not alone in this because it makes me feel crazy "
326,3,"Hi there. I’ve been having ptsd ever since i got fired from the Boys and Girls club. i’m not sure how to explain it so i’m just going to like start from the beginning. 

August 2023, i was 19 years old, i had gotten moved to the new TK-kinder after school program we were having which happened to also be at the elementary school i went to. I was put to work with my new supervisor who was a very nice lady, she was also the mother to one of my friends from theater tech in high school, but he was younger than me so i graduated before him. My supervisor was really accommodating, she knew i struggled in high school and still have anxiety and depression i was struggling with. There is a strict rule about staff to kid ratio, if there is a certain amount of kids there needs to be atleast 3 staff in case one needs to go to the bathroom there are still other adults watching the kids. Our supervisors were not getting us another staff so it was just us two. This put a lot of strain and stress on us because watching a bunch of kids all on our own can be quite hard, some students needed more attention than others and would act out quite a bit. The people higher up kept telling us they would find another staff member to help us out but they never did. Even though it was just the two of us, we managed to still do really well and had 100% positive parent feedback. My supervisor was more the energetic type and i was the more chill laid back type that the quieter kids would come hang out with for a break, i love to draw so i would do art with them. This job was my favorite, i lived a walking distance away and my supervisor and I got along so well. It comes around to september, september 28th to be exact. Some back story for that is i was raped by different guys but on that same day just different years. which is an insane coincidence but it really fucks with me. Seeing as we had a staff shortage i could not call out of work so i had to go to work. i’ve been diagnosed with PTSD and experience flashbacks so i was very dazed off all day, was not doing well but i was still able to watch the kids. i managed to get through the day and felt awful and immediately texted my supervisor/coworker and told her why i was behaving the way i was that day and she felt bad and immediately asked if she could do anything to help. the next day i come in to work and she informs me that one of the parents thought i was high at work because of how i was the day before, which she knows i wasn’t, and i wasn’t high at work. The following week our supervisor above my supervisor pulls me out of the classroom while my coworker is reading to the class and she interrogated me asking if i’m on any substances while i’m at work. I obviously get very shaken and panic because i was not and i tell her im not but she decides to watch me for the rest of the day. wednesday rolls around and it was a really hot day so i had gone to the closer clubhouse center and asked for a ride….and it was the Head supervisor lady who doesn’t like me. As she gives me a ride i decide to be honest and tell her why i was not performing well that day and she gives me “sympathy” but then later on at the end of the day her and my coworker/supervisor sit me down with papers saying that i was on drugs on the job. I argued saying i wasn’t because i wasn’t. One mistake i did make was getting too close with my supervisor and she knew i smoked weed. so they told me the weed i smoke the night before affects me the next day. this is bullshit because i live in california and my other coworkers have weed stickers on their water bottles. I broke down into tears because this was the one job i genuinely enjoyed and was doing well at but this one fuck up lead to my downfall. they told me that i was too depressed and i needed to get help with my “substance abuse” which i don’t even have. they never drug tested me and even then everyone in california smokes weed, you honestly need it when you work in childcare. up to this day, i’ll be 21 soon, i have vivid dreams/nightmares of working at that job and walking through my elementary school like im going to work and they get so real and it’s terrifying. especially because i know im not supposed to be there and it feels like im doing something so awful but then im going about my job taking care of the kids while my brain is like “you know you got fired so why are you here??” i dont know how else to describe it ive been having these nightmares for years now. obviously i know now not to get close with people i work with but yeah, it still haunts me every night. "
327,2,"I was just prescribed 1 mg prazosin at night for ptsd induced night terrors. I’ve been on it for a few days and while it’s been helping my night terrors immensely(yay!), I wake up feeling like I’ve gotten hit by a train and it doesn’t really get better I kind of feel like shit for most of the day. I’ve been tracking my blood pressure and it’s normal but I do feel light headedness, weakness, headaches and slight nausea for most of the morning/day. I take Vyvanse and prozac in the mornings and thought that would help wake me up but it hasn’t. Anyone have similar experiences and did your side effects eventually go away? Just not sure if I want to continue because I’m worried it’s going to start negatively impacting my life during the day "
328,0,Did you notice any improvement regarding insomnia and memory?
329,1,"I was diagnosed with PTSD recently due to my dissociative tendencies, saying the direct  cause was a car accident (the car was totaled but no one was hurt) and an incident of emotional abuse. It is extremely hard for me to even fathom that either of these circumstances could be classified as “trauma.” 
There is just so much worse that happens to others with PTSD. On paper, these incidents seem like nothing, so my diagnosis just doesn’t feel fitting. 

Maybe my mind is rationalizing these two incidents unfairly. I am embarrassed to admit to myself that these minuscule events could be considered trauma at all. "
330,0,i'm looking to get ptsd treatment. my psychologist at my old clinic is suggesting emdr. i only got state  medicaid. just wondering how ppl got their help and their suggestions. thank you.
331,3,"I have been in and out of this state for the last two weeks. I’m on high alert. Sometimes it gets intense and leads to huge fights with my partner. I keep over analyzing and scrutinizing his behaviour and reading way too much into everything. 

How do I get out of this state? It’s very stressful. I can’t sleep, have not been eating and can barely work. The only thing that kind of helps is I keep telling myself that I’m safe. "
332,1,"I'm still trying to process everything. We were such a good match, together for two years in our late 20s, facing all of life’s ups and downs side by side. I truly believed we were soulmates. We had promised to stay true to each other and support one another through anything.

But everything changed when she began treatment for CPTSD at an outpatient psychiatric clinic. Just before it started, she suddenly broke up with me, saying she wasn’t ready for a relationship by phone. It felt abrupt and confusing. Still, we agreed to stay friends and keep in touch as before.

In the beginning, I tried to be there for her. I sent messages every morning, offering encouragement. But her replies became fewer and more distant. Eventually, she told me the treatment was making her feel more depressed, frustrated, and irritable. She asked me not to contact her for a while.

Naively and as an idiot as I was, I asked what had gone wrong with the therapy and whether there was anything I could do to help. I wasn’t trying to hold onto the friendship, I just wanted to support her, because I was heartbroken not only by the breakup, but by how much pain she was still carrying from a lifetime of trauma. She’s lived with complex PTSD since the age of 5.

I’ve read *The Body Keeps the Score* multiple times, and I’ve gone through research papers on innovative CPTSD treatments. I knew she had to end therapy 5 years ago because of harmful experiences with therapists. I wanted to share what I’d learned with her, to be useful, in any way I could. But she refused to engage. She told me that if I ever contacted her again, she would block me.

So I stopped to contact her. But before that, I sent some gifts to her from a roadtrip with my friends last week. And just few days later, I saw that she had blocked me completely. All contact from her was gone. The last message I got from her was a 1 min long voice message, saying that I violenced her private space, I should go f\*ck myself, she hates me forever and doesn't want to see me ever again in her life. This really left me confused and heartbroken.... I am still processing the whole situation.

I gave more in this relationship than I ever have in any before. I tried to offer her everything I could, my time, my care, my energy. I truly did my best to be there for her in every way possible.  
And yet, it's been incredibly painful. It keeps me up at night, replaying everything, wondering what I did wrong."
333,2,"they never broke the restraining order & they never mentioned wanting to work in my current industry, but i still can’t breathe when i hear there’s an interview happening unless i can find out the name of who they’re interviewing. i don’t think they know where i work as i don’t have it posted anywhere, but i’m still terrified of the possibility that they’ll be at my job or they’ll find me.

i feel insane and don’t know how to bring this up to a therapist. it’s been years since the restraining order expired but i’m still scared."
334,2,"I’m just so physically tired and I have a good sleep schedule. I didn’t know being on edge and jumping all the time would be so physically draining. It’s only been 11 days, but does it get any better? I literally drop a pen on the table and I flinch. And if I see someone suddenly then I change my stance and end up squatting??? Idk it probably looks goofy as hell. and it’s irritating when it happens at work because then I get weird looks and I can’t tell if that means they’re mad at me or not. Like I am a normal person but I’m just anxious and fearful all the time now. I feel so burnt out. I only told one coworker because I wasn’t thinking of the risks. But she’s started saying ‘left’ or ‘right’ or ‘behind’ whenever she’s going to be walking past me. It helps I think, but it also feels like I’m being babied now."

336,2,"I'm writing this cause I'm currently having a panic attack due to my child hold trauma, find writing works and always wanted to tell my story so here it is, I was born into a life of crime with drug trafficking parents, we moved often around Alberta and eventually moved to the city, the inner city with the addicts and such. After a while we moved to a notorious neighborhood known for crime and gangs, I was about 6 years old when I started walking around with a knife me and my brothers and friends, about 7 when I first pulled a knife on someone for stealing my bike, I aint gonna talk about stabbings, anyway in this neighborhood seen a car blow up, shooting right around the cormer from my place across from my friends so police sent us home, our school went into lock downstairs often cause of shootings, eventually CPS took us, where I accumulated tremendous amounts of trauma, suffered abuse such as starvation as punishment, locked in rooms for hours or days, and witnessed many suicide attempts by other children, some successful, I eventually got into crime when I was 12, this spiraled into felony crimes, like gta, armed robbery, assulat with a weapon and orgized crime, this was all before I was 18 I didn't think I'd live to see today, I'm 24 now, I stopped crime after I turned 19 cause I chose to stay at home and drink my sorrows away, suffered alcoholism from 17 till I was 22, during this time from age 17 to TODAY I've lost about 20+ to 30+ friends and family members to gang violence, drug abuse, suicide and natural causes, i was close to alot of them so I suffer panic attacks DAILY thinking I'm gonna die, thinking I'm gonna be next, and this is very hard to deal with, but i remind myself to meditate and breath and ground myself, well I'm sober now and am in collage studying for my degree in virology and psychology, I do my own research on topics I find interesting such as the gateway experience, I'm also doing well with my rap career which I just recently started using to help coop with my PTSD, I've lived a wild life and I'm still young, I know pppl lived more wild lives then me still hard tho yk

339,2,"Hello, I took a near death fall while rock climbing. I had to be helicoptered out. The rescue took around 5-6 hours. I had an open fracture wound where my foot was dangling and my bones were exposed. I have a fracture on my face. Plus, I got a concussion. I thought I was going to die. I even came to an acceptance of death as I was holding my friend’s hands tightly, telling them how much I love them as we all cried together. I’m definitely traumatized from this incident and having a lot of PTSD flashbacks. Does anyone have any similar near death traumatic PTSD? What are other symptoms? I just can’t stop crying. I would love to hear other people’s stories. "
340,2,"For the past year or so, I’ve been dealing with a resurgence of memories of SA from a high school relationship. I’ve been having episodes of intrusive memories and panic attacks, and while I’ve never been officially diagnosed with PTSD, I’m starting EMDR therapy once I’m able to go back to therapy, and I’ve had therapists reference it to me before. My issue is that during and after these episodes I’ve had a lot of difficulty speaking. It feels like my brain and my mouth completely disconnect. I know what I want to say but can’t even open my mouth to actually speak it. Is this something anyone else has experienced? I’m not sure if it’s directly correlated to the possibility of me having PTSD or something else. If anyone does experience this, what have you found to be a good way to still communicate your thoughts to the people around you? My boyfriend and roommate are there for most of these episodes and I’ve found it really frustrating to not be able to properly communicate with them."
341,1,"One thing people without PTSD don't realize (well, many of them) is that PTSD is not just some diagnosis like an anxiety disorder. It is way deeper. It goes to your core. I feel like there are two versions of me which are so different as if they are two different people:

A kind of anxious but innocent, happy-go-lucky, hopeful person who was social, trusting, had an easygoing way about things, felt supported and connected with life, with people, with nature. That was me. Yes, anxiety peaked at time,s and I had issues with people, but fundamentally, I belonged, I connected, I was part of this world. I had dreams. I worked toward things. Life seemed long and reliable.

No longer.

Now I'm this other person who is paranoid, disconnected, alienated, isolated. I can't be soothed. I can't be calmed. I don't trust people. I don't trust the process. I don't trust life. I can't connect with nature, with even my own body. My body scares me. It's an alien land. It's unpredictable. Sensations suddenly come and go. I can't sleep. I've filled my body with medications and their side effects. I can't connect with my therapist. I can't connect with friends. Friendship means nothing. I could lose people any time. I could die any time. There are no guarantees. Things don't cohere. Food doesn't nourish me. Nice words spoken to me go through me and make no change.

There is no hope, no tomorrow, no promise. I've seen things I can't unsee. The curtain is torn. Every single day feels both extremely short and extremely long. Things don't build up on each other the way they used to, so everything keeps falling apart by the end of the day, and I can't build toward anything. So every single day is a new test and a new survival. Things I own mean nothing to me. I can't feel God or the Universe or anything spiritual. I simultaneously exist and don't exist. If I get lucky and have an enjoyable time for a brief period, the first trigger will be felt 100 times more painfully because I had my defenses down by accident. That teaches me. Every single day, every single hour, is torture.

The old-me, I don't recognize that person. And that innocent person would be too horrified to recognize me."
342,0,"I'm really interested in this, especially after finding out someone who is close to me is a veteran. Do they see the other person as dramatic? I'd love to know

edit: I realize that the title of this post/question came off as a bit ignorant, if I could edit the title I would change it to;

“How do those who have PTSD from war view people who have PTSD from different events?”

sorry for the confusion! I believe that any kind of event which causes someone PTSD is always valid, and that there’s no reason to compare, especially because PTSD doesn’t discriminate, and it can happen to anyone, no matter the trigger/cause. 

I hope everyone in this sub is doing well! You’re valid."
343,2,"It invalidates people. It gaslights people. It is a form of victim blaming. It weaponizes therapy. Uses therapy as an insult. And its why people don't speak up when they are bullied or abused. Only reason I spoke up this time is cause those 2 guys would not stop screaming at me , they refused to leave me alone after I told them to leave me alone and were weaponizing threatening the cops to intimidate me. So then I called the cops and the cops took my side. 

Even after you get evidence people like to call people paranoid. Its why victims of abuse from anyone (family, spouses, strangers,) dont speak up. Cause people will think ""an awful lot has happened to you. You must be paranoid."" Well... i guess leaving my ex was no use then cause you won't believe me anyways and will just call me paranoid. I guess going to the hospital to get the injuries checked was also useless cause you will call me paranoid. 

As far as last night, the cops even comfirmed that this side of town is sketchier than the other side. But if I said that people would have called me paranoid.

I also grew up in an abusive family, but because so many people wanna say ""An awful lot seems to have happened to you. You must be paranoid."" I guess there is no point in mentioning that either. 

I have also been a victim of theft multiple times in my life! And no, I did not hallucinate that either! Criminals/thieves steal. Obviously they usually don't confess until they get caught. But because criminals will commit crimes, you wanna call me paranoid. If crimes never existed then police and security footage would not exist in the first place!

So many people accuse real victims of either ""having a victim complex"" or they accuse them of being paranoid. Or they say ""You think everyone is out to get you."" "
344,2,"Has anyone ever found themselves in a state where anxiety has subsided, depression has subsided, life has got back to somewhat normal but your brain is still very alert? I feel like I'm on Adderall or something. It's no different with or without medication, I am just constantly hyper focused. It's a strange feeling, I used to nap a decent amount or get tired after a strenuous activity or just a long day - no more. I used to drink some and catch a buzz - now my brain just powers through that / am completely unaffected; I feel zero effects and can drink unlimited amounts (not that I do) and not feel anything. I'm not hypervigilant where I'm scanning for threats or my heart rate is up and I'm stressed / anxious over anything at all. It's almost like I'm just always more focused / alert. Un-aided sleep is near impossible because of this so it can be frustrating.

Anyway, it's only been 4 months since I had a trauma response and what I think was low level PTSD. 

Maybe I just need to give it more time? Curious to hear what others may know or have experienced on this... "
345,2,"I'm a 43 year old woman who has been on HRT for 3 months but I don't always take it properly. 

I've had PTSD since I was around 18. It surrounds a few traumatic events in my life. An incident occurred a month ago that triggered my PTSD but I still feel on edge and anxious. 

I guess my question is to other women on HRT for starters, does it effect your PTSD?

Also, I'm not medicated for PTSD. "
346,1,"Does anyone feel completely debilitated and defeated after waking up from a night full of constant nightmares? I woke up several times throughout the night drenched in sweat and my knees and legs were propped upright. My body is extremely sore and I have a horrible headache. I am feeling just so dissociative towards the day and my to-do list. I have come a long way with PTSD and regulating emotions, managing triggers, etc; but—the nightmares still completely stop me in my tracks. "
347,1,"m33, I still feel all the shame of being called names and being told I don't deserve something. I really hurts and it just feels like it slows me down. I feel like I have a hard time expressing myself because of the abuse that i went through."
348,3,"Obviously I’m agitated but I think it was my fault anyway. They said they let me go for their sake and mine because they didn’t want me to have panic attacks and feel uncomfortable every time I went to work. It sucks. I felt like a liability because I was too mentally unwell to actually keep a job. All I ever did was cry and I got angry with people who didn’t deserve it. I hated going to work and I was miserable. I got startled every single time someone said my name and I always felt sick. I hated people who shouted at me & I dissociated way too much. I was bothersome and I can see why they didn’t want me around. I was the face of their company as an employee. 

I don’t even want a job in the first place but I need money. People irritate me and people scare me. I cry far too easily and as a man I know I really shouldn’t do that but it’s hard. I was pretty sensitive before my abuse and now it’s just worse. This is fucking ruining my life. It’s messing up my ability to work and keep a job and it’s infuriating. I want to be normal like everyone else. I didn’t mean to cry or have panic attacks but I’m not the type of person to bottle up my emotions or “fake it ‘til I make it” because that makes me feel worse for some reason. If I’m pretending I’m happy when I’m not, it just makes me realize how unhappy I am and I get emotional. 

I need some advice anyway. To those with jobs dealing with people (specifically retail since that’s the only thing people seem to be desperate for but that isn’t the career I’d ever want) ((sorry, by the way)), how do you deal with it? How do you not cry? Or dissociate? Or want to kill yourself? I need a job to keep myself stable. "

Somehow, I got certain comments stating the reason for mental health issues was karma something I heavily disagree with. Somehow, they're not professionals but believers where I'm an atheist now after deconstruction from Christianity and not at all tied to Buddhism. Somehow, even the one who said that I've a (portion of) PTSD downplayed it often addressing it as merely anxiety where he did the same even when I asked him to give a letter for me to give to the university for seeking accommodations (Although, there're no laws here protecting us) He was really mad at that but as per my arguments based on his own sentences caused him to write a letter in really bad handwriting where both PTSD and OCD weren't addressed and even when I questioned him, he didn't answer. Somehow, when considering meeting the previous psychiatrist 5 for the 2nd time without even addressing my trauma he said that everyone experiences this and he's not gonna address that. Somehow, under the given circumstances I don't see any possible reason for him to downplay trauma other than either to confirm that he never made a mistake or adjusting to the cultural norms not to validate my anger since he thinks that I should respect the authorities without claiming that they're responsible where the Schizoaffective Diagnosis all because of what's inside my head. Somehow, this was further confirmed when I got to know that natural disasters such as tsunami were attributed to trauma. So, I'm gnashing teeth (in both literal and allegorical sense) over them. Somehow, when I asked ChatGPT too, it confidently showed the red flags of how I was treated. My current dosage of risperidone is 5 mg where I reduced it to 2 mg gradually by myself despite what doctor prescribed and thereafter I started feeling better than before. To be honest I've been taking this drug for too long under psychosis but in reality I don't have psychotic bizarre episodes or bipolar like symptoms where CPTSD appeared as the best fit. Even per the discussion I have had with ChatGPT. Also, the doctor asked me whether I feel improved after getting the drugs. Somehow, when I explicitly said ""NO!"", he allegedly claimed that he saw an improvement in me"" which I disagreed"" So, under these circumstances I'm really hopeless about what to do. I don't even know which psychiatrist that I should meet. I often feel like consulting a psychiatrist from betterhealth or 7cups but can't afford for that. ChatGPT always pointed the red flags behind this. It's what encouraged me to share thoughts through reddit or 4chan. So, while I respect the rules mentioned under this sub reddit, I also think the ultimate purpose of these sub reddits should be giving the help to those who need help. Therefore, I kindly seek your empathetic response. Thank you very much for your time and consideration."

352,2,"Or is this a symptom of something else? 

I have PTSD from harassment which culminated in psychosis last August which lasted around 6-7 months and I’m still dealing daily with minor symptoms. 

One of them is that my mood drastically changes from feeling great and like the world isn’t as bad as I think, and I’ll get better and be okay again, to feeling everything’s sinister, having delusions and panic over the harassment and fear of it returning, and suicidal thoughts. 

It’s happening every day with no break where I feel ‘okay’. I feel like I’m going through these sharp ups and downs multiple times a day from feeling really good to feeling extremely low with no middle ground. 

Is this a PTSD thing? It’s exhausting. "
353,2,"I have difficulty interacting with people. I have allowed my military trauma to control my life and avoid people.

354,3,"Currently, the most exhausting part of my PTSD is without questioning the haunting sleeping issues I have to deal with on a regular basis. I'm currently under a lot of stress due to my living conditions which makes my hypervigilance go ballistic. This, on the other hand, affects my sleep. Whenever I'm dozing off and my mind starts slipping away, I get these adrenaline jolts through my body. After that, I'm usually wide awake again. I'm trying my best to just let it happen and not get caught in my worries about me probably having another terrible night. The longer it goes, the more likely I'm at risk of getting tremors in my legs and the feeling of ""vibrating"" because of stress in general. I'm already using CBD, melatonine, magnesium glycinate and breathing techniques to calm down.

The longer this goes on, the jumpier I get as well. I'm already sleeping with earplugs because of my hypervigilance (sudden sounds are especially triggering), but sometimes they don't help. Do you have any further advice? I usually love reading on my phone (with dark mode on etc) to keep my mind busy while falling asleep. But I tend to wake up after initially falling asleep for 10-20min and then the above mentioned adrenaline jolts set in. I'm going to move soon, so I hope this will help, but til then, I'm hoping to find a way to help myself. Any tips or suggestions are welcome, this is really eating me up..."

TDLR - drunk MIL kept touching me without permission, caused me to have flashback and panic attack, now I have to deal with her again and want to run away instead

Long story short, I was diagnosed with PTSD a few years ago after struggling for decades with being sexually assaulted as a child. I did a year and a half of exposure therapy and my therapist considers my diagnosis to be largely in remission. Because of what I went through as a kid, I sometimes have a problem with people touching me without permission (that and remaining silent when being touched even though I want to say no), which is the core of my problem right now. My in-laws don't know about the CSA or my PTSD diagnosis.

Last weekend, I (36m) went with my boyfriend (37m) to visit his family for his dad's birthday party. His mum has a history of alcohol abuse and it is a major bone of contention between her and her two sons. I have never witnessed her drunk before in the 3 years we have been together, but as soon as we arrived, I sensed something was wrong. She was overly touchy-feely with me and kept trying to hug me and hold my hand. I was wearing a tank top and she kept touching my bare shoulder and stroking my body hair. (To contrast, she is usually a very reserved, somewhat aloof woman who keeps her distance).

We sat down for dinner together, and my bf's mum and aunt were visibly drunk, slurring words and saying a lot of weird shit. MIL would not get away from me no matter how I tried to avoid her. My FIL hasn't been drinking alcohol for about 6 months now after a new health problem so he was fully sober. MIL's drinking problem has created this unspoken tension so I didn't feel I could say anything about her being drunk or ask her to get away from me. It was also FIL's birthday and I didn't want to rock the boat.

I closed my mouth and held it together until it was time for bed, but by then I felt so numb and disassociated that I couldn't process what I was feeling. I was in the guest room crouched down by my suitcase and MIL came in the room and basically climbed on top of me and bear hugged me, so I was trapped underneath her in a crouch position until she decided to let me go. After she left, my bf and I talked a bit before sleep and he was very upset so I didn't tell him about my problem. 

I woke up in the early hours of the morning after having a flashback-style nightmare, sweating and heart racing. I started to have a panic attack but was able to bring myself down from it. I felt violated and disgusting and i understood then that it was MIL's behaviour that caused the panic attack and flashback. I spent the following day avoiding her mostly. It has been a couple of days since the situation, but now I feel guilty and don't know what to do. My bf also feels upset still, but there is the added problem that I feel like I can't really explain to him what I feel now because it's like I am piling another problem on top of an existing problem that's already hard for him to cope with.

We are meant to be going to stay with them again this coming weekend and I am DREADING it. I really don't want to go, but I don't want to hurt my bf. I could really do with some advice on how to deal with this situation because I feel so trapped right now and I am so scared that MIL will be drunk again and I will have to deal with this again. "
356,2,"So I've been taking Prazosin for a little over 4 years now. It's always made me hallucinate a little and groggy in the mornings, but nothing like what I have felt today. I took it last night, the hallucinations started 15 minutes later and were intense, and today just has been off. I have been drowsy all day, sick to much stomach, had the cold sweats, my heart (while the rate was normal) feels like it's going to pound out of my chest, my head is absolutely killing me, my throat is sore and I can't seem to drink enough water, and I've been shaky most of the time. I took it around 2300 last night, it's now 1800. I do feel slightly better than when I woke up, but still not great. The Prazosin is expired but everything I read says that it is not harmful to take expired Prazosin. So does anyone have any idea what this could be? I would really appreciate the feedback. Thank you in advance!"
357,0,"Many people in my area now think panic attacks are PTSD.  PTSD isn't very common so I think that's why people misunderstand it, and because of the trauma awareness movement they think PTSD is any disturbance and  a validation, while other disorders aren't.  Anxiety and depression are also very serious disorders though.  PTSD has been misunderstood and it really hurts people who have it to be even more marginalized by currents trends."

360,1,"I don't know why or what triggers it but I've noticed there has been an increase in times where I reach a near seething rage and I don't know what's triggering it. But it's enough that I feel like a one man army and I hate it I feel angry enough that I just want to fight the world and that's not what I want to be I mean I'm a fucking search and rescue technician, I like to help injured people not cause that shit. I don't like feeling this anger yet I just get these outbursts. Why am I like this, it never used to be like this. Even on SSRIs the extreme fear and anger are still there it's just the happy side of things seems to get muted."
361,1,"I've often thought about where the soul of a traumatized person dwells. What that landscape may be. The inner terrain that no therapist ever can know. I get a dark dungeon or cave or the absolute wilderness with no map, no light and no guide. Just me and the wind. How does this resonate?"
362,2,"For context, i would not like to go into any detail but I was in a very severe car accident before the start of this school year and was diagnosed with PTSD. For a final project today me and my friend had to present news articles on books we read in class and one of the books was the Great Gatsby. For some reason I didn't think about it and chose to make an article about a scene in the book with a car accident.. I dont know why i didnt think it through but as i was presenting it to the class i started getting very visibly panicked and breathing very fast, but i had to keep reading and describing the accident and it felt like the world was spinning and that i was just going to start sobbing. I feel so stupid because I should have known better and that I should have picked a different event from the book to write an article on but somehow I just didnt think of it. 
Again, something that happened prior to this in school was in my physics class we were doing an introduction to momentum and force and my teacher started using car accidents as an example, but the question he started out with was, ""has anyone ever been in a car accident?"" And when he said that it felt like the whole world collapsed in on itself for some reason, maybe because i wasnt expecting it but it was the worst physical reaction ive ever had. I felt like my vision was blurry and it made me feel like somebody had hit me over the head and i felt dizzy and weak and this time actually had a full panic attack in class because after that he started playing videos of bad car accidents in slow motion and playing them over and over. Luckily i sit in the back so nobody noticed except my friend who got up and made me leave the classroom with her. I just feel like this disorder is constantly embarrassing me at the worst moments and I hate that I cannot control when it happens. I wish i could just be a normal kid that could present an AP Lang project without having a panic attack because its related to a car accident. I feel like my reactions aren't warranted and that they're overdramatic even though i do truly know that i went through something horrific, it still makes me feel dumb around normal teenagers."
363,1,"Tw wilderness and camping things
My trauma is extremely rare, never saw anyone who went throw the same and considered it traumatic.

Because there is no way someone survived sa and now there is me who is terribly afraid of being hungry and having diarrhea. 
It feels like it wasn't enough trauma and it was too much trauma at the same time. And that I am literally the only one who has it like this *eye twitching*

364,2,I (21f) have had ptsd from childhood trauma for years and thought that I was getting better. I had a flashback in the shower but thought that it was just caused by a bad day. I have since had 2 more flashbacks when trying to shower. I didn't get triggered by the shower before and I don't understand how it would be connected. Thoughts? Advice?
365,2,"I want to know what is PTSD and CPTSD is like? I'm wanting a better understanding so that I'm able to recognize it better in others.
What's the best way of dealing with someone having a moment?
I wonder if I got it. I don't know. I know that I have several triggers that teleport me back to childhood (not good), my best friend dying, or my mother laying on the floor dying.
I always joked that I love to travel back in time. I was not meaning like this. I nearly shut down completely and sometimes I do when I teleport back to the bad times.
Loud talking triggers mental issues. Sometimes it triggers the teleportation. Sometimes both. Others wonder why I start staring blankly, sometimes cry, or get agitated or violent and avoid life for a while.
So what can y'all teach me?"

It’s been a few weeks using prazosin now, and I can say I haven’t had a single PTSD nightmare. 

Now I have some bizarre dreams, some anxiety dreams about forgetting stuff or having insane acne… but no relived trauma in any of my 21 nights of taking it. 

For reference, I was having about 1-2 trauma dreams per week before trying this med. 

My quantity or quality of sleep has not improved in any meaningful way. However, my fear of sleep/dreams is slowly subsiding. I can foresee my sleep improving now that I’m starting to let my guard down. 

I am currently at 3 mg a night with no side effects whatsoever. 

I hope this helps someone. May you all heal and find joy again. 🙏 "

368,2,"Any advice on how to get over or chill out with random startle response. Partner and I confirmed we are going to DC for 4th of July and going to a baseball game and hopefully to see fireworks on national mall. Hate to cancel our plans but I absolutely can't stand the loud cracks and booms of fireworks, I often flinch and everyone overreacts and it makes me feel really uncomfortable. I've always flinched/jumped at loud slams, bangs, pops and it's not a surprise to my partner or anyone else as most know my story but I'm just over trying  contain it and hide it. Any tips or ideas to help anticipate loud sounds would be great.

Also Im military and I actually don't flinch at work I've been told to do what I do there but honestly I'm not even sure what's keeping me from jumping out of my skin at times. 

I do the whole, I need to get up and go to the bathroom or need to stretch bit but it feels incredibly obvious in my head that it's clear I'm removing myself on purpose from stuff and I just don't want to do that shit anymore. "

I’ve heard of other veterans hitting or choking their partners in their sleep but it never happened with me before. Just now I was having a very violent nightmare I just punched wife pretty hard. Fortunately it was in the back of her shoulder and not her face, but I still hit her pretty hard. She’s back asleep now and I’m lying here wondering WTF.

Talking about how I feel stresses me out to no end.

Pry a hole in me

Right where my sternum is

Let the poison bleed out of me

Let it empty me whole 


Remove the congealing blood, puss and filth covered 

""thing"" thats seethes while it beats

 In that putrid hole 

a rotting mass lost to Festering bloat 

Lost to pulsing infection 


Propelling toxic sludge along,

Barely able to travel in the stringent valves,

Struggling to process even familiar pain

Remove it and cure me.

I don't want it to take the rest of me

I don't want it to rot the rest of me 


Rip it from its cradle of bone and blight

Let the flesh and mind free

Let me rest for good 


It's long since expired

Rancid meat 

Cruel memories decay

A lump of nerves that never forgets.

372,2,"As the weather gets warmer and we near 4th of July, the folk in my neighbourhood are starting to break out their fiecrackers and fireworks.

Like many of us, post-trauma I have disvovered I absolutely loathe them with a passion. I low-key hated them before, but tolerated them for the colourful lights. Now I think they're just plain evil and should be classified as a form of public torture.

My trauma has nothing to do with 'splodeys or guns or banging noises. But between autistic sound sensitivity being compounded by post-traumatic hyperacusis and a startle response that is through the roof, I can't handle fireworks. They overload my system into a panic.

On Easter midnight this year, someone at my parish had the bright idea to set off fireworks like they do in the Old Country (Greece) when we went outside to sing Christos Anesti. I almost blacked out :( I was constantly flinching and ducking, and shaking and crying, utterly disoriented. Someone had to lead me away from where it was happening and tell me where I was and what day it was and hold me upright so I wouldn't fall over. Realised afterwards that this is probably what my dog goes through every year when she hides under the pillows on the couch, whimpering. Worst thing I've ever been through, except the stuff that got me there in the first place.

The other night, someone next door set off a few firecrackers while I was wearing earplugs and noise cancelling headphones, and it still jumped the heck out of me :/ This is my first year going through ptsd, so I'm really nervous about how things are going to go leading up to the 4th if I can't even handle my neighbour's wimpy backyard firecrackers or literally just a few minutes of celebratory fireworks on the church's lawn.

Does anyone have any tips or suggestions about how to get through it without totally freaking out? I'm very sound sensitive to begin with because of neurodevelopmental stuff, but the reactivity symptoms from the ptsd on top of it all are awful :("
373,1,"so I was raped 13.1.2025. at 15 years old, I have that date just locked in my mind and I can’t forget it. After it happened I have become very very hyper sexual and I haven’t told anybody about it bc it’s embarrassing to me.

At the time I was talking to my now boyfriend L. 
I have just become very hyper sexual, it just feels so wrong that after a traumatic experience with sa, that makes me want sex even more. 

For example recently a guy I had met at comic con, we we’re talking and I happened to tell him abt my other traumatic experiences and he had said “I’m always here if you need someone to talk to, and I always have a shoulder for you to cry on” and after he had said that I felt obliged to give him something of me for being there for me so I had sent him photos even though I have a boyfriend but it just feels like I need to give something sexual to get affection from others and that just feels so wrong. 

I have even become way too sexual towards L and I know it’s not healthy for me to be like this and want sex all the time but I don’t know wth to do about it. It feels so hard and it’s very hard to explain how it feels, and It’s feels really wrong bc most of SA victims I have seen have become asexual and not hyper sexual. I’m just so confused and feel so stupid

I have only told L about this just yesterday and I almost didn’t even tell him because I’m so embarrassed about this."
374,3,"I was on a bus not so long ago when an old iPhone alarm buzzed off on someone’s phone and I wanted to get off the bus I was so stressed and my body was all heightened because it was the same alarm noise i used to have when I was younger and needed an alarm to play every 15 minutes between the hours of midnight to 6am, to keep me awake because I had to stay on guard for attackers trying to find my home and burn it down in an ongoing feud. 

I have no burglar alarm or fire alarm and I live with my family, I was not willing to risk a thing and I couldn’t tell them they were in danger because if they made a police report, they’d have to give a name and address and our home would be burnt out without question. 

I couldn’t let myself go to sleep properly at night time for like 3 months until the tide turned and circumstances changed. I knew that the time I would be attacked would be between those hours. In the day time I would sleep from 6am to midday and spend the rest of the day out of the house doing what I had to do.

——————

We are both 20. She has always struggled with anxiety and depression— but her brother took his own life 3 years ago, and the aftermath continues to impact her life in many awful ways to this day. It took a little over a full year before she started to text our friend group again (both in group chat and individually). She has continued to open up over time, which seems to be a good sign. Of course, the more she opens up, the more details I learn about what she’s struggling through, and it’s tough not knowing how to help her. Here’s what I know at the moment: (1) She was the one to find her brother afterwards. (2) She has felt suicidal in the past, but currently does not and has not for a while. (3) She has potentially self-harmed— a year ago she had some red scratches on her inner thighs, which she said were from a cat. (4) She experiences nightmares every night they wake her up at 4am each day. She can’t easily fall asleep in the first place, and it’s impossible to fall asleep again once she is awake. The other day we had a sleepover, and she told us the following morning in that she only slept about 30 minutes. (5) She has been restricting food lately. She is 5’9 and 180 but says she “needs” to be 160 because she personally “feels overweight” even though she knows she’s already at a healthy weight. (6) She was talking to a therapist for a while, but stopped a few months ago. A very close friend of hers, G, with whom she used to confide a lot, told me months ago that she didn’t think the therapy was helping her. She and G had a falling out last year and aren’t in each other’s lives anymore. I believe that my friend doesn’t currently have any person she speaks with openly about her struggles. (7) Her family was shattered by the event. Her mom has become an alcoholic, and each year, she has to guard her parents overnight in the days surrounding the anniversary because on one occasion one of them expressed that they wanted to/attempted to end their own life (I don’t know the details). (8) Maybe not relevant to her PTSD, but she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder about a year ago.

As far as what we her friends have done to help— When we have sleepovers and my friend experiences her night terrors, we try to calm her down and let her know that everything is okay. I used to send check-in texts from time to time, though I haven’t lately. I encouraged her to start taking steps to getting a therapist again, but I am not sure if she kept up with this once I stopped asking about it. We have all said the classic “we are all here for you,” but since she isolates herself when she isn’t doing well, the words feel empty. We don’t know how to be there for her without being explicitly told when and how she needs support. So, that’s why I’m here. If anyone here can relate to her struggles— how can the people in your life best support you? "
379,1,"My childhood home was chronically emotionally neglectful, and verbally abusive.  Because of this, it felt like my brain turned off it's ability to plan for the future or see anything without tunnel fusion. Always heard that ""the lights on but nobody's home"" type stuff.

Since initially moving out two years ago, each of my random roommates have been loud and similarly verbally combative about how I ""don't care"" or an messier than they would be, not considerate, (meanwhile the actual truth of the matter is that I'm too considerate and will shrink down.)  I also missed my gf to suicide last April and haven't been coping well. It feels like I'm now permanently in shock. 

It's always been true that my cognitive deficits from these experiences go away, or lessen greatly, when I increase distance from my parents. It now feels like that's not true anymore and I need help getting information, or any personality out of my brain. I can't hold conversations, I just go silent and avoid eye contact. I no longer interview well, or can as easily access best practices for my profession. I used to not be this way. The last two years has aged my brain 50 years. I don't know how to get it back and it makes me so angry at myself. "
380,2,"I'm a 26/F *trigger warning* (just in case) 

Brief trauma history for context:
So I was SA by family when I was a child, by a group of guys at 13 and as a teenager older men would groom me and use me for my body. One was a lawyer, doctor, psychiatrist, music producer, men in higher ""authority"" or ""power"" but also just the average middle class men too. 
I ended up in a really bad relationship with an older man when I was 20 who was very manipulative and a bit narcissistic and after 2 and a half years broke it off. I started having panic attacks during intimacy while with him and self pleasure.
I've been single (intentionally) and no sexual intimacy (unintentionally T-T but still for the best) for over 4 years now and I feel like I've come pretty far. I'm very good at communicating boundaries now, standing up for myself verbally, and self pleasure isn't as triggering anymore. I'm good at identifying the red flags I missed growing up and staying away from people that display them. But still, even small encounters still get me super tense physically, walking by men in the gym or in public I can feel how my body tenses, even a causal harmless conversation will leave my hands literally shaking and it takes a moment to calm myself down.

It's created so much mistrust with men for me and I feel like because I experienced it from so many different types of men, my brain uses that as justification to trust NONE of them! Everytime (not often, like 3 times over the past 2 years, 2 friendship, 1 romantic) I try to get close to a man who finally feels safe, friendship or romantic, I immediately feel like I'm trapped in a mind game and it's impossible for me to let the relationship just play out overtime because I feel so trapped and anxious, as if I were in the smallest box possible, so I usually just ghost them because no matter how much I try to regulate, I feel like I can't, I don't understand why. And for a romantic partner I usually explode in verbal rage, like ""BURN IT ALL!!"" rage and say the most intense crap that I know of someone EVER said to me I'd immediately run in the other direction. 

Outside of my relationships with men, I have thriving female friendships, a career I love and enjoy my life. I never go out of my way to intentionally hurt people at all, I always try to make people feel loved and accepted but once it comes to a man getting close to me I feel like all that goes down the drain and I become this monster and it feels almost impossible to control. 
This is something I'm working on in therapy. I used to take medication but it never helped. I've tried acupuncture, sacred plant medicine, energy work, yoga and other holistic approaches which I feel like have helped me heal, accept and grow in all areas of life from other traumatic things I've experienced BUT this one (although it's helped me become extremely more aware of it which I guess is a start).

Sorry for the ramble. I am a person who likes to improve and grow so realizing this and seeing how I continue to struggle with this is frustrating as f*** and makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I feel like it's important and will be good for me to have healthy relationships with men but I really just don't know how and feels like it's impossible for me .-. Part of me wants to avoid it entirely because I don't want to put myself or someone else through the emotional turmoil.

Has anyone else experienced the emotional chaos of this and what has helped you rebuild trust in men and or regulate yourself when it comes to more intimate relationships with them, friendship or romantic."

382,2,"(didnt know what flair to use)

since around April 2024 ive been dealing with constant depersonalization and derealization. nothing in particular happened but the entirety of last year was horrific for me. it has not stopped and i tend to spiral pretty quickly when the smallest thing triggers me (and also dissociate worse obv)

does this sound like ptsd at all? i talked to a therapist last year and he said i ""fit the criteria"" but there's no official diagnosis. and i genuinely just wanna understand this better so i can stop dissociating and overcome this for once"
383,2,"So, I’ve been through a couple things in life. 

I saw my parents were in an abusive marriage, divorce, had abusive/estranged parents, I moved out at 18, and got chased and literally hunted for the better part of a year. All that fun stuff and more. 

It’s been a couple months since the worst parts. Anyways, I’ve still been feeling on edge and like I’m getting into fight or flight mode. I’ll be calm and someone will make an innocent comment, but my mind will identify it as a threat. There’s no reason for it and I’m trying to talk myself out of it and I start going through the logical reasons why I have no reason to freak out. But as soon as I pick up on any little thing that’s a trigger for me, it starts a whole overthinking process and it gets me paranoid. I’ll just wake up feeling hunted, feeling like someone’s coming for me, even though it’s most likely not even true. Like paranoid, heavy breathing, hyper-alertness, etc. Not even the relaxing music was helping. 
(If it’s of any help, I’ve also, in a way, partly missed the trauma. Like right now my life relatively peaceful, but I’m having trouble adjusting. Part of me wants to be back in fight or flight mode. I miss it.) 

Ok, rant over. Anyways, I’ve been feeling like this today and I had that question. I can kind of see why I could, but I also understand it’s not something that can be easily diagnosed. (I have been seeking counseling anyways so this will come up at our next session, I just need to be pointed in the right direction, for myself)"
384,1,"I haven't really had a lot of experience with talking to others with ptsd (especially familial abuse ptsd) but i was wondering if any of you feel like you're constantly cruel to yourself? I have been told quite a bit that I apologize for every small thing that technically isn't actually my fault? It feels almost like i'm desperately trying to prevent something from happening (like someone hitting or yelling at me) but others have also told me I tend to be incredibly hard on myself, and to the point it's almost mean?

Do any of you feel similarly? I've been in therapy for a long time, but sometimes I feel like i'm learning new things every day about myself."
385,2,"I’m just posting this to vent, I’m not asking for advice or anything. 

When I was 16, me and my family were hit by a drunk driver and our jeep rolled 2-3 times. It was super sudden and it happened at nighttime, but thankfully seatbelts and airbags saved our lives—although of course we all had to go to the hospital for our injuries. I really don’t want to go into too much detail about the crash as I’m already having flashbacks as I’m writing this (I have flashbacks every single day and occasionally nightmares as well) but it was a really nasty crash. 

I just remember screaming as glass shattered all around me and I felt the motion of the car tumbling. I remember thinking I was about to die, but for some reason in that moment I also thought that if I screamed louder maybe the car would stop rolling…? I know that sounds stupid but I was definitely in shock and obviously not thinking clearly. 

My brother was in the front passenger seat and somehow as luck would have it, his seat was reclined (he was sleeping) and the roof caved in DIRECTLY where his head would’ve been if he didn’t have his seat reclined. My mom was knocked unconscious and doesn’t remember the accident—she was awake but not responsive and had blood dripping all down her face and she kept making this mumbling noise and she couldn’t focus her eyes on anything. I was next to her in the back seat and my other brother was driving, he and I didn’t have as many bad injuries but obviously still had to be checked out at the hospital. My dad wasn’t with us when the crash happened, but when we called him to tell him about it he broke down and lost it.

I’m just writing this because I really need to get this out. The constant flashbacks and fear of being in ANY moving vehicle and anytime, especially car rides at night time, fill me with an insane amount of anxiety and dread, like I’m waiting for another horrible crash to happen. 

I am 22 going on 23, still live at home with my parents, have no job and am completely agoraphobic. I have tried therapy/counseling, both inpatient and outpatient, have tried multiple different medications, and absolutely nothing has helped me at all. I have no desire to leave the house because I am constantly living in fear that something horrible is going to happen, whether that be another car crash or just anything sudden and tragic. 

Even before the crash, I’ve always had EXTREMELY bad anxiety and constantly had this sense of impending doom. The fact that one of my worst fears came true makes me feel like something worse or similar is going to happen to me again. 

I’m also undiagnosed autistic (and likely have ADHD as well) and have always been incredibly sensitive and emotional. It feels like no matter what I do or how hard I try to push myself to get out of the house more often, that feeling always lingers. I’ve also had severe depression and suicidal ideations since I was 15, about a year before the crash. 

I also feel like maybe I did something really bad in the past and karma hit me by scarring me for life and not allowing me to live a normal life like everyone else seems to do with ease. I was definitely bullied a bit growing up, but I would retaliate and bully the mean kids back and I was labeled as the asshole—NOT saying I should’ve retaliated because now I believe that two wrongs don’t make a right, but I do feel guilty and can’t help but feel like the crash is my punishment for being mean back to my bullies, as they all got to live (seemingly) normal, happy, even glamorous lives. 

I also have tons of pent up anger at the intoxicated woman who hit us, as she got maybe a little scratch on her car but otherwise was totally fine (of course). 

She pretty much got a slap on the wrist because apparently she was under the legal limit (we were driving through Charlotte, NC on a long road trip back home to PA when the crash happened) and she came from a very rich family. That’s all I know about her besides her name, which obviously I’m not going to share here. But yeah she gets to go back to living her best life meanwhile I’m too terrified to leave the damn house because of her. 

TLDR: I have severe PTSD from a car crash and am too afraid to leave the house. "
386,1,"abuse and tragedy have followed me my whole life. I'm going through a waking nighmare not to mention the actual nightmares. my mind full of voices rioting against one another and me. my mind is always struggling to not flash back. I'm isolated i hope someone will help me. but odds are ill be ignored, called a liar, or generally demonized. like all the other supposedly safe places to talk about pstd. please proove me wrong"
387,2,"I don’t know how to start this or if this even the right place to ask about this, but i’ll just try to make sense of it all for anyone reading.

So yesterday my partner and his sister and I all took a THC gummy, it was a medicinal one and it was my first time having one. Everything was fine for a while I just got sleepy and giggly for a few hours until I went to bed.

My partner and I were about to like get intimate, nothing had really happened yet he was just kissing my shoulder and rubbing my back with his hand,,, and at first it felt really nice and then all of a sudden it starting building up into feeling really wrong until i started to hyperventilate and i told him i didn’t want to do it.

At that point I felt like something was flooding into my brain? But I couldn’t piece it together, at first the fear was coming from being touched + being terrified of like remembering something bad until it delved into just pure terror.

I don’t really remember what I was thinking or what was going on but I remember curling up in the fetal position and covering my head and I think I was just making really loud whimpering noises? Or maybe I was screaming I don’t know how loud I was. I remember saying no a couple of times and I was just so scared. Like I knew nothing was happening to me in the moment but I felt like i was remembering something awful. Like I feel like I could see a shadow of it in my head like such a vague sense of a memory that was so, so scary? I kept hitting myself in the head too I remember trying to make myself stop thinking about it but it wouldn’t work and I just sat there had the most intense attack i’ve ever experienced in my life (i’m 24 right now). My whole body was shaking from my head to my toes it was surreal, I’ve had panic attacks before but nothing like this,,, it was so so scary 

It took me hours to come out of it properly with my partner’s help but I have no idea what happened. Some things are telling me it’s a trauma response and then I have friends just telling me i greened out but it felt so. so real and i’m still so upset and scared like I can’t think about it without getting worked up. I couldn’t say it out loud at all and I still can’t really, I did text my partner about it at least and he wants to try and set me up with a therapist but I have all these doubts that I’m just like …stupid or something 

idk i have like almost no recollection of most of my childhood, plus not enjoying touch very much and i’ve always had a fear that something bad happened to me that i don’t remember but i’m quite an anxious and irrational person so i don’t know. 

I don’t know what I’m posting this for I just want to know if I’m like crazy or if it sounds like something serious or i just greened out,,, if anyone even reads all that sorry and thank u

388,1,"TW: Suicide.   
  
I wish I could tell you one more time. Just one. 

I wish I knew more about your battle. Oh my sweetheart. I am so sorry.   
  
You are the one I am proud of the most. You are my hero, who live life so fearlessly, even though you got bombarded by pain after pain. I want to hold you, tell you that you are safe, give you so much love right now. What do I do? "
389,1,"it’s been six years since it happened. i did emdr, cbt, meds, etc. i improved my condition but the pain and despondency are still prevalent, and frankly, i fear that it will never dissipate. 

i dont expect to ever be truly “normal”. frankly, that possibility is out of the window. 

i’ve grown to dislike myself for the things that have happened to me. i know there’s a version of me- where everything turned out right. 

the version where i ended up staying with the girl i loved. the version where i never pulled the trigger of my dads pistol. the version where i was never raped or abused. the version where the possibility of true happiness wasn’t mere quixotry. 

i don’t know how i’ll be able to live like this. living is a curse and after this many years, it becomes exhausting. waking up in the morning becomes a pointless sisyphus-like effort. 

i’ve lost my faith in god. i’ve lost my faith in most things. i’m not sure why i even bother living anymore.

390,3,"Hi all - 

I'm feeling at a loss these days. I'm moving out of the apartment I shared with a man who abused me for months and I feel straight up broken. I feel so triggered as I move through this space, taking down shelves and putting my life in boxes. I keep having flashbacks and I feel so helpless and lost. I feel like he has so much fucking power over me even though it's been months since I kicked him out. We haven't spoken or seen each other, which is good and for the best. but I can't help but feel like I'm still under his thumb.   
I'm working hard to work through the trauma and dismantle it (therapy and EMDR) but fucking fuck I'm so tired and frustrated. I feel like every moment there's a new layer to pull back to work through what he did to me. I just need to put my feelings out there. thank you for witnessing me <3"
391,2,"I have a formal CPTSD diagnosis and have been having PTSD nightmares for years now. They’re terrible and make me afraid to go to sleep. I talk, scream, kick, and hit in my dreams, and it’s not uncommon for me to wake up drenched in sweat.

Does anyone have advice for lessening or avoiding PTSD nightmares? I’ve already tried creating a bed time routine and practicing good “sleep hygiene”. Any advice is welcome, these nightmares are wrecking my mental health.

Edit: I already have a prescription that supposed to help. It doesn’t.

Edit: Sorry for not clarifying my night time routine. Every night, I put on rain sounds and read a book in bed. Then I either leave the rain sounds on, or I put on narrated stories or Bob’s Burgers (my comfort show). I have to wear a mouth guard when I sleep or I grind my teeth really badly."
392,2,"Hi. So, I work as a restaurant server. In this industry, there is little regard to other rules that could get one into serious trouble at a professional job. There is almost always no HR department either. 

I have cPTSD from many different long-term forms of abuse, including physical. Due to the PTSD, I become ENRAGED when someone I don’t know very well and/or don’t like touches me (especially excessively). 

I just started a new serving job a few weeks ago and have one coworker (female) who excessively touches me. She rubs my back, will lightly grab my arm to get my attention (instead of just saying “excuse me,” etc.). She also wildly flings her hands very close to my face every time she speaks to me. 

I have a history of losing jobs, partly due to the PTSD. I am really trying not to lose this job. I’m about to go into work in a little bit, happen to really not feel well today, and I’m already freaking out about dealing with the excessive touching. I have severe anger-management issues and am afraid to ask this woman to stop touching me, because I don’t know how to just ask things like this in a rational way. I usually don’t speak up and then let the resentment build up until I severely FLIP OUT on these coworkers. 

When this coworker does this to me, she doesn’t realize it puts me into absolute fight mode. I am literally ready to fight people when they touch me. It also makes me think that they think my body is their personal property (because of past abuse). I then get into this obsessive mental loop about how I am their “property” and get more and more enraged. 

Does this happen to anyone else at work (or elsewhere)? How can I simply ask this woman to not touch me without sounding like a freak or psycho? Sorry so long. Thank you. 

"
393,2,"I need some validation about this situation. It happened I was in grade 4, (I can’t remember my exact age but I couldn’t have been older than 9 yrs) and my sister was in grade 1 (6 yrs). 

My sister was being harassed by a girl in her class. As far as playground bullying goes, it was pretty rough  We were already ostracized, being brown in a small catholic town. Even as children we understood that the rules were different for us and we needed to behave. 

The supervisors were neglectful, now, through adult eyes I can’t believe they let this behaviour go on. 

I told this girl off, I didn’t care what my consequences were, I knew damn well you don’t get to treat my sister like that. 

The next day, I was walking with my sister to school. Again, we lived in a small town so there was rarely cars passing us. A car slowed beside us, and the window rolled down. 

A man was shouting at me. He was the girl’s father, he outright threatened me, told me not to talk to his daughter like that unless I wanted trouble, said he knew where I lived and that I’d be sorry. 

It must’ve over the course of two weeks, walking back and forth from school, this man would roll down his window, verbally harass me, threaten me and drive off. 

He was an adult, I was a child, I assumed he was in the right, and I deserved to walk everywhere with my back up. I was getting anxious but his daughter kept harassing my sister, so I kept defending her. 

I would’ve never told my parents. If he had stopped at yelling at me through the car window, they would have never found out. 
Now as an adult, I feel sick thinking about the way the school discovered he was stalking me. 

Apparently, this man walked onto the school ground, and began asking the other kids where I was, that he was looking for me, and that he was planning on taking me home. Thank god I had a doctor appointment that day. 

That child was moved to another school soon after. He faced no legal action, it was brushed away. 

I’m glad my sister was safe. I hate that I never got over the feeling of a man having his eyes on me. I haven’t felt safe since this happened. My guard is constantly up, ready to be harassed and abused. I wish he had had faced more consequences, that he was more shamed for what he had done. 

This man still lives in the area, I doubt he has any regrets about the way he acted. I’m sure he feels as though his daughter was wronged and cast away. I wonder if he knows that that was the consequence of how he acted. "
394,3,"I had been dieting and for the past 6 months went to keto diet while being already very low body fat.. it went great until I decided to go even lower and now I'm broken. 

My body doesn't produce hormones, I haven't dopamine from anything and zero appetite. However when I don't eat carbohydrates every ~4-5 hours I feel intense panic attack to the point I want to die just to stop feeling that, it's like impending doom feeling.. I force myself to eat carbs and my blood sugar rises too much, but at least this panic attack stops and I feel calm.. How to cope with that?.. it's incredibly scary. 

I developed some kind of insulin resistance due to keto and now planning to go on vegetarian plan just to optimise my carbs metabolism, it's incredibly hard."
395,2,"My past abuser is my coworker. I absolutely despise it. It constantly triggers me to see him and I see him almost every single day. I’m having panic attacks and flashbacks at work. Quitting isn’t the path I want to take, nor is it really an option for me. 

Anyone else experienced something like this? Any advice?"
396,3,"Hi all! First time posting here, probably deleting later, but need to take it out of my chest. Basically I'm taking an English class that asked us to talk about a topic personal to us and I thought it would be a good opportunity to talk about something personal without making it trauma dumping, with metaphors and so on, kinda owning my path to heal from the traumatic experiences. For sake of understanding but not saying which was, I'd say it was Supernatural (show which includes topics of death, demons, traumatic experiences, etc). So I prepared it for day 1, I had issues with technical equipment but easily fixed with peers help though teacher complained on the selected platform to make the slides (that information I've never seen it) anyway I explained it fast due to the 5 minutes limit, so it was the show, shadow work and stoicism the slides about. 

 After that, I was ambushed on the hallway by this teacher to make it simpler because 'she didn't understand the topic', just focusing on the philosophies for the upcoming class in less than 24 hours otherwise she'd fail me. So not so happy about it because it was very detailed but I prepared it for the second class. 

So in that second class, before my presentation other classmate chose the topic of martial arts how it was gender separated and respectful and that was the last drop for me because of my personal terrible experience in a martial arts setting in my adolescence and that sentence began bringing back memories of unsafe. So then it was my turn but I could see already voice cracking and nerves. I began explaining then teacher again interrupting 'I don't get this' that I explained but of course already lost the track of my time planned for 4 minutes, that ended up in 6,5 minutes. During the end of it, I was begging 'give me a second', 'where was I explaining? ' and finally the resigned 'Can't I do this again', replied with silence. Also by the end of the presentation teacher was clenching teeth and holding a cronometer in her phone and it was worse even that pressure. After that, the Q&A section that I replied standing still but not sure how coherent it was from my side. I usually quote to myself stoic quotes but I couldn't think of no one then, not even able to unplug a device after the presentation. I did cry unaware of it, but didn't hide in the bathroom, and at the end of the class I forced myself to talk to other classmates hidding I spent silently crying for half an hour. 
Now at the stage of considering how to move forward like avoiding going to classes on the trauma anniversary day related to that martial arts episode coming within next months or how to see some sort of accommodations like not participate orally in that class. Like if teacher prefers to fail me, I don't care but I don't want this to happen to me again. "
397,1,"I'm pissed!

I know in my heart that what happens in my life does because there is something to learn about it, but God I wish I were just clueless and ignorant about so many pains and heartbreaks.

Last year, I met a guy in my neighborhood, he had opened a shop right on my usual path to the subway. Everyday or so, I'd briefly peek inside and observe the work progress. One day, I saw him, rather his stature and likes, I couldn't see well without my glasses but I could tell I'd like him if I really had a chance to see him.

At that time, I was working at this terrible job where abuse was at every corner, colleagues were coming to work scared, angry, drained or crying because of the amount of incredibly low vibrations this business was holding.

In the meantime, this guy and I got to realize that we were attracted/interested to one another via throwing intense looks at each other. It was pretty ridiculous I have to admit lol. He would pass by me with his bike or motorcycle and instead of looking ahead, he would look at me, etc. The problem was that he wouldn't talk to me or say hi first, actually he just never did 'till this day lol. So, I took matters into my own hands and gave him my number. He invited me out later that same week.

And it was during that week that my PTSD got triggered. An aggravating, lazy, bully guy I was paired with at work came in dead drunk and high. The guy was never truly sober, but after Colombia lost the Copa, he just couldn't take it. Upon arrival, he had shared with me how sad and screwed he was because he bet on that game and lost so much money and that he couldn't take it. I really had to work for the both of us that day because of how disconnected he was. He kept on bumping into me while I was trying to keep everything together on a very hectic day, up to a point where I had to tell him to back off! Well... He got right up in my face, ready to fight and kept on shouting ""What? What?"".

Mind you, I had been paired with him for months, and although I've never seen him sober, I had never seen him that angry, and ready to hit me if I spoke back. And right there, I saw my brother trying to kill me when I was 11, I saw my mother punching me as hard as she could, and I saw my dad lifting me and throwing me on a bookshelf (...). I was mortified. I felt stuck for a minute, wondering ok, I guess, I need to abandon my job and fuck it if the business is impacted, because that day, without me, it was over, for everyone!!

I started to leave, I was removing my uniform, packing my belongings... The only manager on site started begging, BEGGING for me to stay. She asked to look at what would happen if I left and that no one else here could do my job, so I gave her one more hour until it calmed down but she had to ask that guy to stay as far as possible from me.

That night, and over the next 2 following months, I was crying for no reason, I had tears coming through my eyes over absolutely nothing, like truly nothing was happening and it would pour for hours. I thought I had heart attacks, my heart was beating so off and there were time where I couldn't breathe to a point where I was feeling nauseous and dizzy. I was feeling extremely unsafe and my blood circulation had been causing me debilitating cramps. My PTSD episodes are really loud too, it always feels like there is noise coming from somewhere and I can't really hear well. I was scared all the time, even when I went on that date with my new neighbor.

Try to picture it, I was going through all of it, while pretending that everything was all and well.

I screwed it up! I tried my best to act normal for months after that date (none followed afterwards, but we would see each other, stop and discuss every other day). And of course, I looked extremely odd!! This, being scared is the only version of me he got to really be around, the opposite of confident, desirable and funny. I looked lost AF!

I did everything I could to get back to good health, I was praying, meditating, going through therapy, go out in nature, meet my friends... And it did help, and I was able to face that episode and put it to rest. I ended up quitting my job and getting my swag back, I missed the timing though, my neighbor only sees me as a friend now (his words), and since I do not do friend zoning, I just abandoned the ship altogether and just cross the street or avoid eye contact whenever I see him (which is often).

Voilà! This is how PTSD screwed my chances with this guy."
398,0,What are your thoughts about the fact that mental illness can cause PTSD in and of itself? 
399,1,"My psychiatric NP suggested that my symptoms sound like PTSD and suggested looking for a therapist who practices EMDR. 

The thing is that I can’t think of one event, or even a series of smaller events, that would have caused this. Is it possible to have it and not know why? And if so, how does treatment look for something unknown? 

I had CBT for a few years and no suggestion of PTSD ever came up with my therapist. I’m just not sure where to go from here.

401,0,"Just wanted to share something positive. 

This year marks 40 years since I was first traumatised, age 3. The trauma of that event was repeated multiple times throughout my childhood, leading me to the core belief that I am not good enough. I have spent my whole life struggling with this belief, desperate to constantly prove myself, constantly scared that my abuser was right.

I have been doing EMDR for a couple of months, working on this memory. A few weeks ago I had the realisation that none of it was about me. It was all him. It sounds obvious, but for the first time in my belief I believed it and felt comfortable.

 And this week suddenly, I smiled and thought ""how silly of him to think a 3yo wasn't a good enough person."" 

My psychologist, a quite reserved and formal person, was literally singing and bouncing woth excitement. I was amazed. For the first time in my entire life, I truly felt like I don't have to be weighed down by that event ever again. "
402,2,"28F I’m travelling the healing path since almost one year. For years I thought I was healing, forgiving people, doing my best all the time etc until I reached a point burnout in august 24. First got diagnosed with cptsd and autism. 

Doctors told me my whole life « you are bipolar » « oh no sorry you have bpd » « ah no you’re depressed and anxious » 

When I had the burnout, I became very cautious with which doctors i choose because I knew my mind was screaming for help and realized I never healed, just repressed everything until it exploded very badly. 

I’m currently in psych ward, leaving tomorrow. 

And I was wondering. Do you sometimes get this weird fear that if healing takes too much time, you might fall into madness/total psychosis ? 

In my case I never had psychosis, hallucinations or stuff like that. Derealisation yes, depersonalisation as well, dissociation. But I’ve never been really paranoid or anything. 

So I was wondering if any of you ever had these thoughts. "
403,2,"I've had PTSD for about 5 years now, and all my trauma until very recently has been from something a person did to hurt me. However, a couple of weeks ago on May 16, a system of severe tornado-producing thunderstorms moved through the Midwest and my neighborhood had a tornado run straight through it. Thankfully, my apartment building is okay, as well as most properties in the area, though some places had roofs taken down, etc. and need significant repairs to be inhabitable. However, my experiences of the tornado and its aftermath have honestly traumatized me and I'm noticing some of my PTSD symptoms ever since the event have been tied to reminders of my experiences with the tornado. It's gotten to the point where I don't feel safe or okay in my own neighborhood, coming home gives me intense anxiety, and I'm constantly worrying that my power will go out or I'll come home to my building destroyed. This is my first experience with natural disaster trauma and I'm not handling it well at all. Does it get any better? Anyone else relate? I just feel so at a loss with how to cope with this"
404,0,"Theory:

One reason trauma is held onto is because there is an avoidance of it; there is a desire to not feel the pain; to not be hurt; to not be that victim again, to not be alone, naked, scared, and helpless. But, the only way we can let go is by feeling these feelings and letting them dissolve. Think of desiring chocolate, the chocolate is desired until the appetite is satiated; once satiated, the desire for chocolate is gone.



Likewise for negative emotions, there is a desire for loving-kind awareness and a calmness so that these can be felt and healed.



Exercise:

First, get into a fully positive state, as high of a positive state as you can get. Whether this is through a breathing exercise like pranayama, or an energetic practice like reiki or qi-gong; or whether just by watching some mindless tv show, or thinking about your most fond memory. However you get to the fully positive state is fine.



Next, slowly lean into the biggest problem troubling you (the trauma in this case, or if not trauma, then just the biggest problem); feel it; yes it feels bad, yes it sucks, you can even say that out loud. You can say how bad it feels/felt. You can say how you felt/feel helpless and like the world was over. Feel it. Once it gets to be too much, and you feel you are going to be overwhelmed with too much negativity for your current capacity, then just stop. Repeat the first step, get into the highest positive again. 



And then simply repeat these two steps until it is fully dissolved and there is only positive feelings left.



Bonus step: If you are able, focus on the problem/trauma while doing the positive state exercise

Example: Focus on the trauma while you are calming yourself with breathing

Example: Focus on the trauma while you are getting positive feelings from your tv show

Example: Focus on the trauma while you are getting positive feelings from your memory



Remember, go slow, be gentle on yourself."
405,1,"I don't know how to say my issue, but when I was 9 years old, my mom, my little sisters and I used to go to my grandfather's house every Friday and it was like a nightmare tradition for me, because when I go there my grandfather touches me where he pretends he doesn't know how to use his phone and as an innocent child I approach him and tell him how to use YouTube and while I teach him on my phone he touches me boldly and I don't understand what it means and this continued every day where he tells me with strange requests to search YouTube for Gore videos because he has a fetish to see people eating by a lion or a tiger. I know it's weird, but he would force me to look for it on YouTube or other sites. I was only 9 years old and he would force me to watch a man eat alive while he touched me. I know it's crazy, but it continued and I couldn't tell my mom because I was afraid that she would not believe me, the last time he molested me when I was 14 years old when he became emaciated and weak due to his cancer where his skin was flabby and looked pathetic, I thought that after those years he had changed and I felt pity for him especially since he had cancer and became like a skeleton, but surprisingly he touched my butt and slapped it and of course this man never changed, and then he died a month later where unfortunately that was the hardest thing for me when I saw people and my mother cry at his funeral and describe him as a good man, grandfather and father. It still bothers me because every period I remember that and cry and got BPD and PTSD, and severe depression even though I am 20 years old, but I feel afraid and disgusted with old men and I do not imagine myself having a sexual relationship and until now I am still a virgin and I do not date any man because I am still afraid and I feel disgusted and want to cry even though I am a normal person and I also have desires, but it prevents me and I feel that I am locked in a cage and I will never date because of my issue."

A week ago I took my long time beloved senior dog with me on a short errand run. Due to a situation in front of me, I had to aggressively brake. This caused my dog to fall off the back seat and become severely injured.

I’m absolutely devastated. I can’t sleep, and the entire accident sequence keeps replaying in my mind. It is torturing me. I also keep thinking of my sweet dog and have been crying throughout the day. This is not typical for me, I’m a strong and successful man. But this is just killing me inside.

409,1,"TW: SA  

So right before a traumatic event happened 2 years ago, I decided to start my healing journey- I had been battling with depression and trauma for years, and I decided I was sick of always feeling horrible. And then I was abused, and It felt like they stole not just my will to live, but my desire to heal and even be feminine (I had been struggling with it for a long time, because I didnt feel safe being a girl due to previous sexual trauma-idk why). 

And someone recently told me I have to change, otherwise I'll be mentally ill forever(they were right). But the thing is, I have no desire to heal. I've found comfort in the pain. And someone already disrupted my attempt to heal, so now it feels too scary to ever even try again :( It also feels like I'm blocked out from ever being a normal girl again, because I feel like I'm too tainted and damaged to ever be a pure, happy girl again. 

Also, I'm now really confident in myself (The trauma shocked me so hard it made me completely change, I used to be so insecure), and my ego is so high that I don't really have a desire to change- because something in my brain tells me if I become soft again then I'll be vulnerable again🫤 But, I know I have to change because I'm actually really toxic to my loved ones (only realising how harmful I'm being when I lose them.), and I'm not being who I really am even if I'm as confident as I always desired. 

Also, I'm not visually depressed on the outside anymore , so it's like I don't *have* to put anymore effort to heal, but I'm still not actually healed yk.

I don't know how to heal when my brain  
is telling me I shouldn't/cant change ever again, even if it's for the better, and I know I need to otherwise I'll be stuck feeling like an imposter in my own body forever. Like the trauma rewired my brain, and is making sure I can never heal and move on from it. I want to actually want to actually heal. I don't know what I have to do or tell myself, but my mindset needs to change. 

Apologies for my horrible grammar :')"

I was diagnosed with PTSD as a child after experiencing a natural disaster. The event itself was scary but because of the circumstances and a court case I was extremely isolated throughout the whole thing and that's why I think I didn't handle it too well. 

However because of time constraints in therapy I never had time to address domestic violence I and some close family members experienced for much of my childhood. That is something that I feel impacts me more day-to-day. Some of the responses I have to it remind me of what I know is PTSD from the disaster. That makes me wonder if it would be worth it to pursue looking into if I could have PTSD from this too?  Can you have PTSD from two separate things and are they distinct, or does it then merge into one huge PTSD? "
418,2,"Hello all,

I've been losing a lot of mental energy lately. Yesterday, I came to realize that our family has been leaving our house keys outside occasionally, hanging on a bike. Once it turns night, the keys likely aren't visible unless someone were to shine a flashlight on it.

Our house is separated by a locked gate that we also leave the keys in (only to unlock the gate), and nearly every night I just set the alarm, so if anyone were to have tried getting in using the keys that were hanging on the bike, the alarm would have sounded.

I'm assuming that in the past 100 days, I've forgotten to set the alarm around 7 times, so technically there is a 7% chance that someone used the keys to enter the house at night.

But, in order for this to happen, the person entering would have to:

1) Reach over the gate and use the key that's in the gate to unlock it

2) Use the keys that were hanging on the bike and enter the house on a day that I forgot to set the alarm

3) Use the keys to lock the door and hang the keys back on the bike

4) Reach back over the fence to lock the gate

My fear is being violated in my sleep and getting a disease, which seems like a silly thought, because that would also imply that:

1) I have a stalker who is aware of the keys being out in the open

2) They would be lucky enough to not try to enter the house on a night when the alarm is set

3) Violate me without me waking me up

4) Be a gay or bisexual intruder with a disease who has intentions of sexually violating me (a 200lb, reasonably attractive male) and not stealing anything, since nothing has gone missing

Typing this all out seems silly now, since 92/100 times I've set the alarm and nothing has happened.

I'm assuming this is OCD or PTSD, since I have childhood sexual trauma.

Any help is appreciated, thank you so much."

421,3,"tw: child physical abuse and also mentions of SA

(also english not first language)

//////////


I've been physically abused since I was 5. My parents got divorced and that's where everything started. My mom got custody and never allowed us to see my dad. I have a sister who's 2 years older than me.

The physical abuse stopped when I turned 12-13 because I grew taller and stronger than my mom, so that's probably why. Here is where I sometimes started to see my dad again, but I wasn't allowed to talk to him if it wasn't replying his questions or expressing any happiness around him, she would be watching and if she caught me having fun with him, like once that I got excited because he mentioned dinosaurs and I was OBSESSED with dinos when I was a kid. That night she hit me non-stop and I never did it again.

From 12/13, the abuse was only psychological and ummm... of basic needs(?) like not being fed, not having clothes that were not full of holes and very small shoes that have hurt my feet for life. Getting kicked out of the house at night just because she wanted to bring a man home when I was between 13 and 17 (i would spend this time in my building stairs if she didn't notice or I would just go and wait in front of another building until someone entered and i sneaked in their stairs. She also did really weird things sometimes like pretend she was possessed by my father and that's why she would hurt me... She also didn't let me sleep at night and I've ended up with a messed up sleep schedule that I still haven't been able to fix for longer than a week.

I must mention she had money, she just didn't want to spend it on her kids and spent it on travels or gifts for her boyfriend, who I hated because he was always teasing me, making really mean and weird comments to make about a child... You know what I mean. When her boyfriend brought his children home, she would treat them so well that I hated them. It wasn't their fault I know, but I hated them. My mom would make us give them our dinner and clothes and anything they wanted because we apparently didn't need them. Her boyfriend would hit his son so much that he got caught once and luckily lost custody. My mom always covered him, and now in the present she sometimes mentions it as something awful, like: ""how could he do that to his child? ""... Like she's completely forgotten about what she did.

So, the thing is when I saw people talking about getting trauma, I onced said to my sister that I didn't feel traumatized, which was really lucky. And she replied that she didn't either because she was fine about it too. We didn't talk about it, we didn't think about it. It was just a fact that we knew but completely forgot if it was not mentioned because I guess it was normal for us, it was all we ever knew about life and childhood.
So I was convinced I was perfectly and it hadn't affected me at all.

Until I turned 18, when I left home and started talking this guy my age and we were flirting and all of that, and he wanted to get to know me so he would ask questions about my life. That's where I started to remember things I wasn't aware that I had forgotten. I didn't tell him but I spent a month crying every single night and feeling so sad about that child. I pictured my younger self as someone else, a child that I had to protect and didn't, and I didn't understand why that was happening so many years after. I guess I was starting to process it for the first time in my life. 

From here, I've been thinking about it sometimes, I've written pages about it, in notebooks, in my phone notes, in message chats with myself, I even told a friend. I went to therapy for some months but the therapist didn't help me at all because she didn't want to focus in my past? so I left. 

I got early access to the internet because my mom didn't too much pay attention to me so I just did whatever and lied about my age everywhere. This lead to me being groomed so many times, and I didn't even considered it as such until a couple years ago. Then, I was SA when I was 19 and 20. I ended up dating the guy that sa'd me and I've never understood why. My friends were angry at me and I lost some because they were mad about me dating him and also about me complaining when he behaved like that because they were sick of telling me to leave him and I didn't do it. After that, I spent a year letting people do whatever they wanted with me and then crying about it and throwing up every night. Tough year. I still cry sometimes out of nowhere during sexual situations, but everything it's better in general, so it's alright.

Now I don't do any of that anymore, and I've been okay with my past this last year since I've left my city, old friends and family behind. But sometimes I've seen something and I get a sudden wave of a feeling I can't explain, a get sick to my stomach and have this fight or flight-like feeling. For example, once when I was watching a movie and the mother took the daugther by the feet to take her out of behind the bed. This sent me into a spiral of anxiety and I felt afraid? 

Yesterday I was reading a book and the MC said something about her being afraid of her stepdad and running out of the house because she was afraid he would hit her. Nothing even happened, but I got this feeling too. It's like a punch of memories. 

It's like I totally forget about it happening and don't see it as something that happened to me but someone else. Also, I sometimes miss my abusers and I don't know why. They never did me any good, but I can't hate them, I can't feel any hate towards them. If they contact me I respond and I even feel bad for them? Because they're trying to be nice? So I shouldn't make them feel bad now that they're ""trying so hard""? Like, I don't get it either, I think now it makes no sense, but when the situation happens I turn into someone else.

I've also noticed that the reason why I stay up all night is because I'm afraid. Of what? I don't know. I just am. I'm alert of everything, I have locks in my door and safety items for doors because otherwise I can't sleep. (I have diagnosed OCD btw, so that's another issue, but I feel like it must be related)

I dont go places without him really, except to the store and work. But definately never social events. I hate being without him, i dont feel safe and i lose all social skills. I dont really have any local friends, just one girl i go to the dog park with. My other friends live in different states and have their own issues and cant handle the burden of dealing with mine. And bad things always happen when he leaves.

Ive been being strong for him. Im acting like everything is okay but i feel shaky and i know its going to get worse before i get used to it, if i do. Im proud of him, i know what hes doing is going to set us up for success. But i also dont know how i am going to cope without him.

When I hear things at night i have to go check on them myself now. One of my biggest issues is self isolation, and im not even chosing it myself this time, its just already happening for me.

I had a 10% chance of surviving that surgery once the mistake was made. 

My kidneys won't recover and I now require dialysis 3 days per week. The hospital put me on a Medical Psychological Hold and moved me to a dark part of the hospital (where they also house inmates that come in for medical reasons). They did this to me because I missed my daughter (my home is 2 hours from that hospital), and they wanted me to stay there until another surgery was scheduled, which was a week out. Typically optimistic, I became so depressed I began thinking of ways of ending my life. I was offered no compassion, support, or kind words. I was screamed at by the Psychologists. I was treated horribly. My husband finally learned he had the ability to supersede their dictator-style rules. 

The lack of compassion and understanding shown by their Psychologists is hard for me to accept. Going into kidney failure is a nightmare, let alone the misery of being away from my child (yes, she's 19, but she still lives at home and is my best friend). I don't know how to cope and I'll never trust another Psychologist again.

429,2,"First time posting here, I’ve never felt like my trauma was valid enough compared to some of the things people post about here so I’ve put it off for a long time.

I had a very traumatic experience at a summer camp when I was a kid—the details of which I’m not super comfortable sharing, but it was really hard on me. While it was happening, I just remember repeating the phrase “I want to go home” over and over. Now, over 20 years later, when I have a panic attack, I’ve found myself repeating that same phrase, “I want to go home,” over and over in my head, even if I’m already home and it doesn’t make any sense for the situation.

Does anyone else experience something like this? Is this normal for people suffering through PTSD? Aside from therapy, which is something I’m already pursuing, how do you handle it? I swear I go right back to being that scared little kid and it kills me."

Its really my mind that has dealt with trauma stuck in hypervigillient mode 

And then when i make a rational conclusion that i am just being paranoid . It makes me realise the effect trauma has had on me continues to have on me

Because of this i dont like things out of my control for instance if its my home or property.... i dont like if its a privatley owned apartment and managment does weird shit like for example they mopped the floors on all levels as they usually do they put a wet floor sign down bit bizzarley they put a door mat on my door

Dont ask why they made me paranoid and trigger a trauma response but thats the nature of how trauma has effected me anyone messing with my shit without an explanation takes me back to fight or flight . 

I eventually realised management are kind of assholes and it was them who placed a doormat at my door but who cares

The issues is the trauma response when people indont know mess with my personal space call me extremley hypervigillent

How do you guys deal with that

Usually its just a matter of a day or 2 and relaxation it blows over. But the stress of things like this that might seem trivial to some but because its based from trauma to me my mind runs riot until i have found out the source and then i can deal with the stress response. Drives me crazy"

434,1,"I’m really struggling with the after effects of an overdose I had when I was 15 even though it’s been several years now. I thought I’d come to here for some advice as I cannot afford therapy rn :/

Basically, I tried to end my life after I was SA and the memories of overdosing have been quite traumatic. I remember taking a whole bottle of pills (about 100) and then I fell asleep. I woke up in the middle of the night choking on my vomit. I got a burst of adrenaline and shot up in bed and threw up everywhere. For about ten minutes straight I threw up nonstop all over my bed and couldn’t move. It was like my body was biologically taking over and trying to keep me alive. I couldn’t control any of my movements. My body just did what it wanted to. 

I remember being absolutely terrified and I just wanted to live. I realized I made a horrible mistake. The throwing up never slowed throughout those ten minutes. I just felt myself getting weaker. My heart rate went from through the roof to super slow. If I had to guess my heart rate went from 180 to under 40. I felt myself dying and I don’t mean “omg I feel like I’m dying bc this sucks so much” I mean actually dying. I’ve heard that animals know when they’re dying from a biological standpoint and that’s what I felt in that moment. My brain knew my body was giving out and dying and it was doing everything it could to keep me alive. 

Around the ten minute mark, as I was still throwing up, I felt my heart slow to practically nothing. My vision started to go out, my hearing was completely gone, and I couldn’t feel my body at all. I’m sure I was still puking in this moment, but I couldn’t tell for sure. All my senses were gone and I only had my thoughts which were also slowing down. And then nothing. It was just blackness. 

When I woke up the next morning, I was extremely high, covered in vomit, and piss. I was taken to the hospital when my family realized what happened. I was held there for 8 hours, hallucinating like crazy. The next day I could only remember snippets of what happened in that hospital. I know I totally embarrassed myself with the things I said while I was high.

The doctors told me that it was physically impossible that I survived based on how much I took and my weight. They didn’t understand how I didn’t choke on my vomit or how my heart didn’t stop. They theorized that my heart may have stopped and started again due to some rare event that can happen (idk it’s a really long medical term) but they weren’t totally sure. I feel like I did die but obviously no one knows for sure.

Anyways, the events during overdosing were quite traumatizing and the after effects as well. My heart was damaged for about a year after it happened and I had a hard time doing anything without getting heart palpitations or it going up to 200bpm. I also haven’t recovered my full brain function since. I used to be known as the smart kid that got all A’s but the rest of high school I could barely understand simple math or remember vocab. My brain doesn’t work nearly as well as it did before and it’s obvious to everyone who knew me before that I essentially became dumb from the overdose. 

I’d just like to hear some of your stories so I can relate or maybe some things that have helped you “get over” the ptsd. (Sorry this was so long)"
435,2,"It will be the second year since that horrible month. It makes my skin crawl to think about. Before my trauma it was my favorite month because it was the same month of my birthday. Now it just haunts me, now it makes me feel horrible. I struggle with SI a lot during that month, and its right around the corner. I'm trying to self soothe but its so hard. Do you have advice for dealing with a trauma anniversary? Thank you!"
436,0,"I will say straight out that EMDR therapy changed my life. I learnt from EMDR therapy that the hurts that torment us don't define us. That was one of the biggest takeaways for me personally. Repair means finding out what that means in practise, its pluriform implications for how we see ourselves and the world around us.

Our DNA is no different to anyone else's; we have to know that and be able to love ourselves. To know no one chooses to live in a dissociation hole. We have to be able to give ourselves enough credit to survive, and break the cycle of internalising all the abuse that leads to things like identity disturbance, dissociation and clinical depression in the first place.

We have to be able able to forgive ourselves despite the judgements of a deeply ableist society that demonises those of us it fails so it doesn't have to answer for its ghoulish failures and its neglect. That adds insult to injury by turning those it fails into moralistic stepping stones so anyone responsible for policy towards survivors can reinvent themselves to solutions of their own making.

The social order that produces Complex PTSD, not surprisingly, doesn't want to know about the deep and prolonged harm it does, or the hurts it causes. Our justice is us as far as I can tell, personally.

Edit: I say that having last worked in a psychology department on a neurodiversity inclusion research project, as part of student retention. Our survey results were like looking into a meatgrinder. I wrote on that for anyone interested:

437,3,"I have been on a healing journey for 8 months since my “breakdown” and although I have seen some improvement, I am still in a state of survival. I am mentally and physically exhausted getting up everyday, after I barely sleep, to battle my mind. Hope is really hard to find when I’m feeling like this. I am doing so much nervous system work on my own. I am doing EMDR now but I can’t even do the processing because my brain shuts down even at what seems like the most basic target. I am afraid I am never going to get out of this nightmare. I have an entire lifetime of trauma to heal from but I still struggle with feeling like I am weak because I can’t seem to feel better no matter what I do. 

Can anyone relate to this?
Have any of you been in a deep pit and actually climbed out?
I’m seriously considering looking into IOP but I’ve never done anything like that before. "
438,2,"i knew in my heart a few months after the trauma stopped, i have many other diagnoses however i knew it wasnt just them - but my grandma didnt believe me

looking back, i didnt tell her everything, but it still hurt enough that i got a psychiatrist appointment and had an assessment (probably for the best as i got alot of diagnoses that day i didnt know about)

she said i hadnt been through enough, it makes me feel awful, i feel like i am being over dramatic for attention even if i am alone in my room after waking up from a ptsd induced nightmare, or when i dont do things that i used to love simply to avoid triggers

then there is my biggest invalidating feeling, my symptoms randomly will (mostly) go for a few weeks sometimes, which makes me think i never had an issue to begin with (they always have come back)

has anyone else had that last thing? my trauma stopped around 2-3 years ago (i cant remember the ‘end’ date as it was repeated), i will have periods of okayish to daily panic attacks accompanied with flashbacks, hallucinations and nightmares, my avoidance and hypervigalence never go away though "
439,2,"TW: SA






I can add more detail, but I met a girl in public, i said kissing was fine but we never mentioned anything more. It was public so I didn’t expect more. She put her hands up my shirt and down my jeans. I froze. I couldn’t speak. I tried to put my hands down to my private area to guard it, I then pushed her arm away but she just pushed back. I then for some reason froze again, after about 10 minutes of freezing I pretended to enjoy it to get it all over with. It wasn’t sa so why do i care?"

441,2,"I have a friend who I think might be struggling with a delusion, possibly related to some trauma they went through in the past. Most of what they describe are tactile symptoms—like skin crawling, which I’ve read is pretty common—but they also mention sharp, electric shock-like pains and muscle twitches. They feel like these sensations are almost being used to condition their behavior, as if someone is trying to influence them in some way.

They also experience a lot of hypnic jerks and audio hallucinations right as they’re falling asleep. I know telepathy-based delusions are a thing, but the specific idea that someone they know is trying to condition them telepathically through these sensations isn’t something I’ve come across much.

Has anyone here experienced anything similar, or know more about this kind of delusion? Any advice or stories would be really appreciated."
442,1,"Hi all I’ve been triggered for over a month now, cry on and off every day this entire time. It’s agony. I have a psych who I see regularly. I try all the things. What am I doing wrong? It’s like the trigger runs so deep. Thing is I need to keep my job, this is affecting everything "
443,2,"i recently came to terms with the fact that i was assaulted twice by a man 25 years older than me in my early 20s (5.5-ish years ago). i did not realize at the time, and just moved on with my life like it was nothing. considered it just an encounter i regretted and immediately put it out of my head. i interacted with him regularly after at the bar and even sought him out to talk to him. at times even thought about the encounter after the fact as it was the only time i had done a certain act that i enjoy but now realizing it was so incredibly not okay. i am now repulsed and disturbed  by this when i think about it and the immediate denial i had and for how long and how i let this man interact with me after. i am heavily doubting myself bc of how i responded afterwards even though, without details, they are both relatively clear cut categorical assault. 

i have been dealing with anxiety and intrusive thoughts that i am concerned will affect intimacy with my partner and has already been affecting my sleep. i acknowledged and named the second incident only two days ago, and the first around 5 months ago. oddly enough i also very heavily feel annoyed that i feel so fragile right now and that this is persisting even for a couple days. i am horrified of the possibility that this intensity will persist long term. i am worried the acts that occurred i wont be able to do anymore , with my sweet and loving partner who constantly assures me those times dont count and therefore he was my first for them. the ridiculous thing is that i am a therapist and i should be aware of things to consider with this process. but applying it to myself my mind goes blank. 

anything you want to share about how you navigated this, especially if you went a very long time without naming or acknowledging the incident?

i hope this is allowed, im sure it’s been asked a million times over. i’m sorry and thank you. "
444,2,"As the title suggests, I was wondering if a PTSD flare up is a thing?

Recently I went through something triggering to me (a specific type of medical appointment, details in my last Reddit post if you want info) and it feels like since then I've been on edge in a way I haven't been in years. 

A little bit earlier I was reading a book and a character said something which was word for word what an abuser said to me right before a really traumatic event. Normally I could manage that okay after all these years but it set off a panic attack. It keeps repeating in my mind and I'm sitting here rocking back and forth like I did as a child (not a regular occurrence these days).

Is this a thing? I feel weird and confused."
445,2,I live literally down the street from the local hospital and so I hear EMTs rush by and every time I hear them getting close I’m reminded of the screw up I did that cost the life a fellow sailor. 
446,2,"These days I can usually mask or suppress my fear of men to the point that it doesn’t cause too many problems for me. The fear is there but I can function through it. And up until  today I wouldn’t have admitted that it was a big issue. But right now I’m pretty shaken by a nightmare I had last night, where my (trans) wife told me she was going to detransition because she didn’t feel safe being trans in this political climate. This is not something she is actually considering doing irl. I think the nightmare stemmed from her telling me about new dose changes for her hormones and general conversations between us about trans rights and safety.

I am ashamed to admit that the nightmare made me realize how much safer I’ve felt with her since she started transitioning and presenting as a woman. Even when she presented as a male, she was always a safe person for me, but our relationship actually became a lot closer after she came out. I was so disturbed by this nightmare that I woke myself up crying. That was a wake up call for me (no pun intended, I swear). 

Now I’m starting to recognize some of the subtle and overt ways I have been trying to avoid men in my day to day life these past few years. This is another exposure category to add to the ever growing list of exposures. I avoid so many things (habitually) but I’m trying to face things head on now.

447,2,"I have been seeing a therapist for a while for anxiety and family issues. Recently I saw where I was given a diagnosis of PTSD related to my dysfunctional family relationships. I am 32 years old and it feels strange to see an official diagnois on paper. My PTSD relates to a dysfunctional childhood, being victim to my mother's mental health issues and realizing how apathetic and enabling my father was. I spent my entire 20's believing I was crazy because of the constant gas lighting and manipulation from my family. I cut contact with them in 2020 and have since started to heal. It is a strange feeling to process events through this lense, but I feel it allows me to move forward. To put a question forward, how do you feel that an official PTSD diagnosis had facilitated in your healing?

449,2,"Throwaway because I don’t want this to be traced back to my main.

So for a bit of context, I was abused in high school for three years. I won’t get into it much here, but it was bad enough that I was going to threaten them with a lawsuit. It left me with PTSD, agoraphobic tendencies, and extreme social anxiety. 
Also, a few months ago, I was dumped, but we later reconciled and became friends once more (friends with benefits).

However, they started dating someone from their high school who looks, talks, dresses, and acts almost exactly like my abuser (acts in the way my abuser did before all of the shit they did to me). Like, it’s uncanny. I had a really hard time hanging around my ex’s high school friend group as I would get panic attacks every time I would see them. 

This same friend also asked out my ex when we were still dating as we were considering maybe trying out an open relationship. Having this person try to enter a relationship pushed me over the edge and caused me to crash out. I got super paranoid about everything my ex did and while I did my best to make it not affect my actions, I do think it caused a strain in our relationship. 

I didn’t react well to this news. I don’t care about who my ex dates. I have no control over them and I don’t want to have control over them. I just wish it was just not this one person. 

I am panicking and I want to figure out how to get over this. But I’m not sure how. I know time will help, but I’m afraid that this will affect how I see my ex. I also told my ex after they told me about this about how much they remind me of my abuser and I’m afraid that my ex now hates me. And I wouldn’t blame them. 

How do I fix this? How do I handle this? I have a therapy session soon, but idk if that’s enough right now. 

TL;DR 
My ex (who I’m still close with) started dating someone who looks just like my abuser and I’m not taking this news well. Idk how to cope with this and how to repair the damage I might have caused to my relationship to my ex. "
450,1,"I went through a traumatizing event and traumatic grief two years ago and I’m just realizing that I’m never going to feel like I did before the event happened. I was in such a great place before but then my world got turned upside down. I feel like there’s not much left to verbally process… right? Like it is what it is and life moves forward. And I have moved forward: Im pregnant with my first child, I live with my wonderful partner, I have better and closer friends. But I struggle with depression and this chronic feeling of emptiness. I dread being alone because I don’t know what to do with myself for hours. I’m trying to do hobby things but it all feels meh like I’m lost in the grey. 

I just started with a new therapist who I’ve liked so far so I feel optimistic about that but just looking for advice, encouragement, or even that this is normal. Idk. "
451,0,"I didn’t realize I suffered from PTSD until 3 years after my assault. 3 years. I always knew it  was a traumatic experience and the aftermath and how it was handled made it worse, but I thought it was just trauma. It was only really it finally clicked when I was completely gone from the environment where the person who assaulted me didn’t exist anymore. I could finally feel peace and like I could breathe. I still have trust issues and don’t let people in as easy I used to, but I’m able to not let my trust issues control and run my life. This wasn’t  confirmed or diagnosed by anyone but myself so I could be wrong but I’m finally free knowing what was “wrong with me”. My brain hadn’t fully processed the trauma for 3 years due to being around people and environments that normalized it, and for never setting boundaries until I had to to protect my own safety. Is there a name for this really late realization?   "

I fought. I crawled i never gave up. No matter how intense my nightmares paranoia or PNES (physcogenic non epileptic seizures).

My and my fiancee celebrated my accomplishments as theh kicked off around the same time.

I felt such a great connection. I lost my virginity that night. 

Ever since then I dont know what's real anymore. Whats good what's bad.

All these emotions forever barried under the mountains of abuse. Sprawling to the top.

I read a true crime case. I now feel sad because the defendant is in jail. And I get sad looking at the victims.

I have no idea what's going on.

I rarely felt sadness certainly not over someone I didnt know. Now, it all comes out.

I care about how I come across. I fear everything I worked for will be taken.

I have a weird urge to read novels like Les Miserables about people going through extensive abuse and being revived (some call it hurt/comfort) 

I have no idea what's going on.

I dont know these emotions they dont feel real they feel invaders coming in my mind.

Im usually sad now. Constantly thinking about someone I see on social media or the news suffering

453,2,"Hello,
I think I have complex PTSD from being adopted and being in hospitals due to having cerebral palsy. And my parents not being supportive of my mental health. Anyway. I have flashbacks every day. But every time I get support( from specific people) I get flashbacks. Like my mental health episode the only thing that I remember( besides part of the episode) is the support I got. And today was my last day of the beyond 18. And my teacher told me I’ll be ok😭😭😭 while hugging me. I have having flashbacks ever since. My teacher said the exact same thing when I was going to get surgery. But I have been having that flashback for 2 years. 
I just wanted to see if I was the only one who experiences this?"
454,2,"I walk around in this fog each day, with random thoughts passing through my mind.  Sometimes I get stuck on a thought that becomes a question, and then here I am asking a billion people their opinion on the thing.    
This thought about time, and how it has become harder and harder for me to grasp has been floating around in my brain for a few years.  I only started using Reddit in the fall of last year, and just now thought to ask you guys what you think.  
I was diagnosed with complex ptsd last year.  During the evaluation, I mentioned how I find it hard to believe in things, and time was one of them.  The doctor told me that having a difficult time believing in things is actually a common thing in people with ptsd.  

Do any of you struggle with grasping the idea?  Like, I know what it means... one hour, two, three, etc.  12:00pm, 1:00, 2:00, etc.  I get that.  It's to measure and keep track and blah blah blah... BUT, it seems that with each passing experience that gives me some sort of trauma, time becomes something distant to me.  Days are just alike, years aren't much different, and an hour doesn't really seem any different to me than a minute does.  

I don't know if this post even makes sense.  I just got out of a relationship where if I were to have asked him about this (and he has ptsd as well,) he would've called me crazy, emotionally abused me some, and then went to sleep.  No need to even mention what I gained from that relationship.  Needless to say, after he left me in the fall after abusing me big time for three years, I have some extra complexities in that ptsd luggage that I drag around behind me everywhere I go."

i'll start.

456,3,I have been diagnosed with PTSD since I was 2 years old. Does anyone else get flashbacks and then have a lack of sleep which leads to them being extremely mad and then them misplacing the anger onto another situation?
457,2,"My ex was extremely abusive. During our marriage I also experienced abuse by one of his friends at one point, something he held against me. The PTSD I was left sign is pretty complicated despite having done a lot to work through it. 

Now, part of my treatment included overcoming or at least learning to manage the anxiety that comes with a trigger. This also meant being aware if body changes when I don’t even know I’ve been exposed to a trigger, to prevent panic etc. 

The thing is, I still have triggers and I know I always will. I can cope with them, for the most part, so I don’t avoid things as I did in the beginning. (I literally couldn’t leave my home at one point, so I’ve come so far.) 

MY ISSUE:

I have a great partner who is pretty socially inept and has no understanding of mental health in general. He tries but due to autism, he just can’t get the problems associated with PTSD. He got us tickets for two shows, two days in a row, but the second day is a show that involves an act I do not enjoy. Why? My ex and some of his family were obsessed with this individual and thus, I was forced to consume the content. There were times when things were violent and bad but this show would make him laugh so it would often be on during drunken bad episodes of his. 

I don’t enjoy the act at all. It’s a comedian and I don’t find them funny. I wouldn’t want to go anyhow, but I certainly don’t want to go to something I know makes my heart rate increase and my stomach churn. 

My partner is pretty insistent I just go, because the tickets aren’t refundable and the seating requires my presence (handicap seating). I think it’s worth me talking to them and explaining what happened, or him inciting someone else and just using crutches or a walker that day. His kiddo is coming with us, so he really thinks I should just go and feign enjoyment. 

I can’t pretend to be happy when I’m going to just be trying to maintain calm. I think it’s perfectly acceptable to avoid this triggering situation as not every trigger needs to be confronted, nor can they all be overcome. I don’t know how to get this across to my partner or if I really should just deal with the discomfort. 

TLDR; Does every trigger need to be confronted fronted, or is it fine to avoid a trigger even if it costs others a bit of annoyance? Content: partner bought his child, he and I tickets to a comedy show but the comedian sets off my PTSD, is a trigger, because it’s something I often had to listen to and watch when my abusive ex was drunk and trying to calm down. This was usually post confrontation.

458,3,"Hi everyone,
I live with chronic illness, trauma (C-PTSD), and neurodivergence. Some days I can function, even plan or get things done. But more often, I hit a wall. I shut down, dissociate, or just lose all energy and focus. My body tenses. My thoughts vanish. Even basic things like feeding the dogs or replying to a message feel impossible.

I’ve tried so many systems(planners, apps, routines) but they all assume I can keep up. I fall behind, feel like a failure, and eventually stop trying. I want to support myself in a way that doesn’t rely on willpower or force. I want something safe, not punishing.

Can anyone relate? if you are living it, can you share what’s helped, even in small ways? What does a crash or freeze look like for you? How do you care for yourself when you can’t do much? What helps you come back without shame?

Thanks for any advice ❤️"

Hi everyone, I’m a 20-year-old guy struggling with PTSD and depression. I’m currently in both medication and therapy.
I’ve always had a difficult relationship with my body, and unfortunately, due to depression, I’ve gained a lot of weight over the past three years and have become obese (111 kg at 180 cm).

I wanted to ask if anyone in a similar situation has managed to lose weight despite dealing with such a heavy mental burden.
It’s probably all tied to my depression and PTSD, so maybe losing weight will come as a result of healing.

Thank you to anyone who replies."
463,2,My symptoms are manageable with medication (Zoloft) tho it is hard to get by in my country so I had to reduce dosage. Queue in… nightmares. Is there anything I can do ? Please do not suggest meditation as it tends to bring about physical symptoms 
464,0,"Hey people. I'm curious what other people do after waking up from nightmares/ a long night of nightmares. I'm also wondering how some people have learned to take care of themselves or cope after nightmares. I think this is an interesting question because of how nightmares can be such a hurdle to regulating and/or recovery, especially in our early days/years.

I wanna clarify I've been at my PTSD for many years. Nightmares used to really fuck me up, result in me canceling all plans and isolating, which made things even worse. I'm grateful I can deal with them a bit different these days, but I'm still interested in how some of us might get ourselves out out of that post-traumatic funk.

Somedays I immediately sit outside and think about the nightmare, what happened it in, and meditate. Somedays I call friends with PTSD and just popoff. Today I immediately had a shower and then turned to watching animal videos (lol). These days, I try to not cancel plans because isolating fucks me up, but I also strive to balance taking it easy at the same time because I'm usually tired af.

Also, can we talk about the god damn laundry we gotta do? Someday I wonder what my landlord thinks with all the loads of laundry I need to do with these damn sheets haha

Why am I such a mess?

"
466,2,"I started therapy about a month ago, and have been focusing on learning to deal with my PTSD symptoms & flashbacks. I didn’t even know I had PTSD, it’s been a lot to handle. 

Since therapy started, I suppose I’ve stopped avoiding the reality of what happened to me. (relationship abuse, SA) I’m glad I’m finally getting help, but I think allowing those old scary memories back into my mind has opened up the nightmare floodgates. Every night, my ex is there. He shows up to my house, my parents’ house, or my office at work. He insults me and rapes me. I try to explain why he can’t treat people like that but he just picks me apart and says I’m not good enough. 

I wish I knew how long this would last. I wish I knew I would feel “whole” again someday. And I wish I believed he would someday leave me alone, even in my dreams. "
467,2,"I’ve heard a lot of people with PTSD, especially childhood related PTSD, have experiences with blocking out traumatic events and then remembering them later in life. My question is, do you know that you’re forgetting something and you just can’t figure out what? Or does the sudden recollection kinda take you by surprise a bit? What’s it like? Also, how did you successfully remember these things? Sometimes, I feel as if my symptoms and triggers don’t exactly match up with some of my trauma. For example, i’m a victim of COCSA, however I get really bad intrusive thoughts when around grown men and assume they’re thinking about/want to hurt me in a sexual context. I also have other triggers involving older men, but I can’t remember anything involving an older guy, nor did I ever question I was forgetting anything until I made this connection. I don’t necessarily FEEL like I’m forgetting something, but not knowing for sure is driving me insane. I’d like to move on and I feel as if I can’t do that until I know what to move on from, yk? "
468,2,"It was commonplace in my family for adults to blow pot smoke in my face or even give me some whiskey to shut me up and make me go to sleep when I was baby. Unfortunately one night when I was 4 years old I was drugged like that and it was the first time I was raped by my grandfather. In addition to PTSD from the multiple rapes I have experienced, I also have medical related PTSD from multiple hospital stays due to COVID related kidney failure among other things. I had a kidney transplant last October and since then I have had multiple other surgeries and hospital stays. I am absolutely terrified of anesthetic, pain meds, or anything that makes me drowsy especially in a public place like a hospital. I have panic attacks every single time. I'm terrified that bad things will happen to me while I'm drugged. The fear is so bad it keeps me from seeking out medical treatment even if it's dire. I'm also afraid that if I panic too much while in the hospital they may restrain me and force me to take drugs that have a calming or drowsy effect on me which is my exact fear. I feel like there is no solution because any drug that would force me to calm down is the reason that I am afraid in the first place. I regularly have nightmares from being drugged over and over again in different scenarios in my life including the hospital stays. I constantly feel like I need to be alert and in control of the situation or else something terrible will happen. Is there any hope for me to ever get over this? Because it feels hopeless."

Like for the porn i watch... I watch a lot of milf porn. I feel gross for this. I fear I'm like my father who was a pedophile. I can't imagine being something worse. My life looks like shit. I feel worthless. I feel like I can't do anything right. I feel like a fake. Like I'm trying to fool people and all the people around me are bad people. Like I'm bad. We all are homeless and deserve to be homeless. We deserve shitty lives. We are all feeling sorry for ourselves because we don't want to acknowledge that we are bad people that do bad things. We're all victims of abuse, but we're abusers ourselves. I feel bad for never being happy around my dog and I should give him to someone that will love him. I'm always dissociated.

I remember having to cope by myself for 1 year because I didn't tell my mom or friends what he had done to me, I used to cry infront of my mom and couldn't even say why. I still try to clean myself up in the shower so I can feel clean again...pure again. All I want is to have my adolescence back. He touched me, he shut me up with his genitalia, he put his hand on my lower parts. I couldn't escape from that hell for a long time. I still hear him screaming at me. I still feel his punches on my stomach. I wish I could just erase it all from my memory. And to think I wasn't his only victim... there were kids younger than me. He lived in the same apartment complex as me and the others, no matter if we tried to, we would somehow always see him walking around, like he isn't doing anything wrong, he seemed so...proud. It disgusts me to this day. 
When the parents of one of the victims told my mother what was happening, she came straight to my room, looked me in the eyes, and asked me if I knew him. I started bowling my eyes out. As I was crying, mom gave me a hug, and while crying, she told me it was all okay now, but I felt like he would come after me if someone discovered him. When I go outside, I always carry a knife with me in case he actually comes running towards me. My mom said that I can't do that...even if it makes me safe. She said he was gone, and I shouldn't worry about it, but I don't believe he's gone. I feel him watching every single move of mine. I've tried killing myself 2 times by now."
471,0,"I’ve just been confused about it even after speaking to a psych and reading up about it. Like I can’t work out of it can be strongly thinking about it when you don’t want to and remembering it and feeling certain sensations or if it’s straight up like you’re back there?

Thank you :)"
472,2,"Hi! This is my first post but I'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions? I went through a traumatic experience a few years ago that lasted most of the summer, and now I find pretty much everything about summer triggering (the weather, the way the light changes, the smells, etc.). I've been in therapy for a while and I do pretty well throughout the other three seasons, but as soon as summer starts, everything comes rushing back and I haven't found anything super effective to help with it. Thank you in advance for any advice!!"
473,2,"My PTSD symptoms/triggers are impacting my marriage. How I respond to things are scaring my husband, but it’s a reaction to triggers. I didn’t respond this way until recently. I’m afraid and feel out of control with my triggers. Any advice?"
474,2,"i was diagnosed with ptsd when i was about 13, im 16 now. sometimes i can tolerate triggers and cope better, but this morning i had a panic attack, now im at school and alcohol is topic for some reason, which is something i could not handle in this specific moment. the discussion was not in depth because it was shut down, but i feel like it stressed me out a lot more than it would on a good day. my dad recently relapsed so that stress is already fresh in my mind. ive done emdr therapy, so i think im already beter at managing because of that, but sometimes (especially after extreme stress) i kinda revert. do you guys feel like your more susceptible to triggers when youre already stressed out? i think i could of handled this discussion on a normal day, i could of tuned out and went on my phone, but now im kind of worked up over it. do you guys ever experience similar situations?"
475,3,"I suffer from PTSD due to multiple life-or-death situations. I live with constant anxiety, but will experience insane levels of anxiety when ""things"" happen. My therapist tells me this is misfiring of my fight-or-flight response (which I agree with). Then, they tell me that I should say to myself that ""yes, this is bad/scary/upsetting/stressful, but it's not life-threatening. There's no wild animal jumping out to kill me. My life isn't in danger"" and eventually it will help me train my body not to experience anxiety like this. However, this all feels fake and empty because so what if it's not an a wild animal coming to kill me? So what if this isn't a fatal situation for me? It's still a ""dangerous"" situation for me even if it's not physically dangerous. I'm feeling so frustrated with this approach.

For example, due to some errors, I got saddled with a massive medical bill that would have cleared out my bank account and still needing to pay the bulk of it. I cannot work due to physical and mental health and have no income. I don't know how I would have gotten the money. I would have had to sell my car and not been able to see any of my doctors that I'm seeing anymore (due to cost). I was in a panic over it for weeks as I navigated every channel to try and get the bill somehow covered. Telling myself it's not a wild animal coming to eat me means nothing.

Another example my therapist was getting me to apply this to was the medical testing I have gotten over the years of us working together. I've multiple times had suspected instances of diseases that were (thankfully) not life-threatening, but debilitating. I'd have to be on additional medications, it would impair my quality of life and/or it would require medical treatments or procedures that I can't afford. I was under incredible levels of anxiety with each test, waiting for each result, going to doctors, etc. I can't imagine how telling myself I'm not in caveman times being chased by a sabertooth tiger would make me any less anxious or see the situation as less threatening."
476,1,"Trying to support a friend for quite a while now. I dont know if this became PTSD or depression, but their behavior does not seem normal/healthy.

\- Family member died a traumatic violent death

\- I send texts to say hi, thinking of you, old pictures, etc every now and then. I would get a reply after a long while (eg; months), they dont seem energetic at all when replying but always appericiative.

\-  My gifts has been rejected (eg; food)

\- It became a very one sided relationship, I dont resent or blame my friend. I have other friends and take care of myself so I can have a clear head to support my friend, but the dynamic of the relationship has deifnitly changed.

Im thinking of communciating my concerns, what do you guys think?"
477,2,"To elaborate, my initial event happened 12 years ago. I've been in therapy since then and also saw an EMDR specialist for about a year back in 2022 after a short spate of panic attacks coming back (that were triggered). Last year, around the same season the initial event happened, I started experiencing muscle tremors mostly in my legs and pretty consistently. Went on for a few months and saw a few different specialists, and eventually one - who also has a psych degree - diagnosed it as residual from PTSD. He mentioned that my body might just be remembering that this is ""around the time"" something traumatic happened, and is reacting even if I'm not anxious.

The problem is, a few weeks ago I started having different physical symptoms. Rarely have muscle tremors anymore but now I have brain fog, forgetting words/phrases a few times a day, writing/typing nonsense when I'm sure I'm writing down a phone number or notes. I was seen at the ER today to make sure I'm not having a stroke or something, and my CT and labs were clear. I'm wondering if this is somehow the PTSD showing up again in another form even though I haven't felt triggered or anxious recently at all. 

Anyone experience anything similar? I haven't heard about it EVER in therapy or in my personal research of anxiety/PTSD, so this is new for me. "
478,2,"I (32, F) have PTSD due to a lot of trauma surrounding childhood. Without wanting to go into all the gory details, I had to be silent as a kid basically any time I was home, or I got screamed at or worse. My stepmother hated ""noise"" and hated my voice (as she told me many times), and so she gave me no room whatsoever to laugh or play or be a kid. And I also wasn't allowed to close my bedroom door most of the time, so I didn't even have the door to muffle sound and give me some sort of leeway. 

This has caused me to develop partial mutism. Whe I get panicky or emotionally overstimulated, I lose the ability to speak. Therapist says it stems from the same thing as my DID and is a defense mechanism my brain uses to protect me. I, or at least some parts of me, associate my own voice with inviting danger. 

Consequently, I also have a very strong trigger response to things that make me feel like I'm not allowed to speak or unable to. And this causes the weirdest things to trigger me. 

My coworker and I are the only two employees at our job and we have a great relationship. We laugh, we joke, we work well together ad we enjoy each others' company. And she knows I have partial mutism. She has witnessed me muting firsthand. She doesn't know the story or my trauma, but she understands enough and is quite compassionate. 

Earlier, we were joking around and she started doing that middle school thing where you mimic everything the person you're talking to says. Most people would find that funny to mildly annoying, I guess. But to me, it made me feel like I couldn't talk. Like I was trapped. I nearly started crying and told her I don't like that game and it's upsetting to me and she felt so bad. I feel bad for making her feel bad; she was just goofing around. Who would get seriously upset by such a stupid thing?

She's sweet and has given me some space to calm down. I'm currently trying to still my breathing, as well as not dissociate/switch. It just feels so stupid that such a dumb thing, which doesn't even DIRECTLY have anything to do with my trauma, freaks me out so much."
479,1,I have been relieved that knowing what has been issues is PTSD but I feel unsure what to do now and what to do to mitigate the effects 
480,3,Mostly *bureaucratic*  and medical personnel - I just can't. It drives me up every wall simultaneously and can't figure out how to without the freak out.
481,2,"Tagged “advice”, but can also be “discussion”.

If you developed hypervigilance due to experiencing trauma or danger in the past, why should you try to get rid of it/reduce it?

Don’t get me wrong - I’m in a constant state of fear and flight-or-flight. I have insomnia and chronic pain due to all the tension and anxiety I’ve held in my body all my life. I don’t like what hypervigilance is doing to me.

But it’s kept me physically safe now. And realistically, due to my appearance, I will always be more likely to be targeted for negative reasons, compared to some others.

I’m hesitant to work towards lowering my hypervigilance, like my therapists suggest, and like I see so many others trying to do.

But I feel like this is the wrong choice? Is it wrong to want to stay hypervigilant?"
482,2,"Assuming u were unconscious… I’m just trying to figure things out bc sometimes I act in certain way that is so out of the realm of me. It’s like someone’s taking control of me and making me act out in ways that feel familiar but I have never even thought about such a thing and am not even consciously thinking about it while it is happening 
EDIT: I don’t think I was being clear. I meant have u noticed ur subconscious mind doing strange things/things u wouldn’t even think about doing in response to triggers? "
483,1,"Idk about y’all but I’m kind of at a place where I would like to be more upfront about my PTSD symptoms. I’ve been hiding it for years out of shame but I decided I want to be seen within my community to get support. My day to day is difficult and I’m kind of sick of wearing a mask. Since may is mental health month, a social group that I am in posted about celebrating mental health month and breaking the stigma. I decided to share a little bit of my story to the group and talk about my experiences with PTSD. I was hoping that I could get some encouragement and understanding from these people who I thought were my friends during mental health month. Not a single person replied back to me. I was left hanging. 

I’m confused why people say they are supportive but can’t even say a word to someone who is asking for understanding. I am craving for the people around me to really see me but I guess that’s too much to ask…??? Do you find people don’t care that you struggle? "
484,1,Sorry if I’m using the wrong flare. I just didn’t know which one applied to this. I posted earlier on CPTSD but didn’t get any replies at all.

487,1,"I was in a bad car accident about five weeks ago, my car was totaled and it completely threw off my life at the time. I have had a concussion for several weeks and just now had my first emotional breakdown about the accident. I feel like I have healed just enough for my brain to actually process what happened to me. I wonder if it’s because my body feels safe enough to process or because the concussion is subsiding and allowing my emotional regulation to function again?"
488,2,"So I was recently in another car accident. I have PTSD around being in several accidents with the maniac driver who was my father, my fiancé and I were clipped by other drivers driving too fast about 2 years ago, and it mentally destroyed me for a long while. 

The recent car accident I dealt with involved my mother driving and someone ramming into us from behind. My therapist obviously noticed I'm still in emotional shock, as well dealing with PTSD. She suggested I try to talk this out with my mom. As, I've been isolating, crying and my mom cannot read the room. She keeps bringing up the accident and its made me super uncomfortable and she legit doesn't seem to care or notice. She finally noticed how distant I've been and took it as a personal offense. 

I didn't think this would happen as, my mother had shown growth through her sobriety buy I guess not...she's just a narcissist who only feigns growth.


I tried to explain my feelings etc...when as I just said, she took it soooooo personally and as if it was a personal attack and quickly denied everything (she claimed she never did anything she did these past few days in classic gaslighter fashion). Not until she was done cursing at me and happy with having made me cry did I get some semblance of an apology. I now know to never attempt to talk about my feelings with her ever again. 

I'm in therapy because she won't go...I said to my therapist I don't want her in the delivery room when I give birth and I mean it (I'm not currently pregnant but when I do have a child, she's not allowed there). "
489,2,"Does anyone know if there are any free online and/or zoom/video support groups with regular meetings? I would willingly attend remote meetings in other countries.

I just received a call about a relative in hospital for serious problems. I can’t get a flight for a while. I’m struggling right now and while it’s tempting me to drink, my sharing would go far beyond the scope of the restrictions in most online/remote AA meetings.

I am also experiencing nausea, headaches, and muscle aches with the eye problems. I also feel the sudden urge to cry every few hours. I’m not hopeless or ideating on anything, so I know I’m okay for now.

494,2,"Hello Everyone,

I was in a pretty crazy car accident about two weeks ago and then 3 days after the wreck I caught COVID. It was a head on collision and I watched this gentleman ram into me going at least 40-50MPH while I was stopped at a red light. No permanent damage beyond whiplash and maybe a mild concussion. Long story short I haven’t felt the same since the crash. I have started getting panic attacks again, which haven’t happened to me for 6/7 years. I can’t shake this feeling of existential dread. It feels like something terrible is going to happen. I’ve had anxiety and depression my entire life but directly after the crash and COVID I can’t get rid of the feeling that I’m alone and something terrible will happen. Has anyone experienced these symptoms in relation to PTSD? Or is this just regular anxiety and I’m psyching myself out? Thank you in advance for any advice/experience you have. "

It feels like I’m permanently exhausted and it’s getting hard to remember basic information or have a good conversation the way I used to. "
498,2,"As a little girl, I was conditionally loved and chosen by my parents, or at least that’s how I interpreted it. I constantly wanted their validation because, growing up with two brothers that were best friends, I always felt like I was alone. My brothers had each other, my parents had eachother. And me- no one. 

This deep need for my parents to love me when my brothers wouldn’t include me or thought of me as a burden turned into resentment. I grew very angry, reactive, and became extremely sensitive to certain noises. Specifically, the noises my mom made when she ate. For some reason it was only my mom that aggravated me, even though she doesn’t eat louder than anyone else in my family. I think it’s because I wanted her love more than my dad’s, and when I felt rejected by her, subconsciously saw her loud chewing as a threat or something I don’t know. 

As a result, this leads to alot of shame. I didn’t understand why I grew so resentful towards my mom. Everything she did started to upset me, but it was like my body had a reaction every time she would trigger me with something she did. I didn’t understand why- I was scared, because all of a sudden I was constantly panicking, my heart beat would be through the roof, I couldn’t think straight. 

It got to the point where everyone in my family was noticing my treatment towards her. It was a lot of resentment that grew towards me. I was a monster in their eyes. Constantly criticizing the woman who birthed me, even though I myself couldn’t understand why. I was basically living in a state of constant fight or flight surrounding these noises, when I think all I wanted was for someone to recognize I was in pain, and needed someone to see me for once. I remember I never watched TV with them because their noises triggered me too much. I would go upstairs and cry instead, knowing they were all downstairs watching as a happy family, and I just physically couldn’t. And they all thought it was because I just resented them, when really, I just wanted to be loved and understood. My pain to be acknowledged, and not demonized. 

There were times my mom would cry. At how reactive I was to her. My dad would tell me over and over about how awful I am, that I needed to apologize to her. My relationship with my dad became extremely bruised because I was hurting the woman he loved. I remember conversations with my  brothers when they would just say: what has mom ever done to you? They looked at me like a monster. 

One day, I looked into it online, and found misophonia. I sent them the article, unsure of how to tell them. With a lot of tears, and a really hard conversation, they got me to a therapist. Horrible therapist, basically just told me I needed to be around the noise more. It was excruciating. They would sit me down and we would all eat in silence; I was instantly triggered and would cry and shake. All while they sat in silence and ignored it, convinced it would fix it. 

So yeah. I think from this I basically have this belief about myself that I’m horrible and hurt the people I love. I’ve noticed in friendships I really care about I’ve become uncontrollably irritated with them, and this often leads to self-sabotage. Which then leads to shame, self-hatred, the belief I’m incapable or deserving of love. I still experience this resentment to new friends I’m making today, and I’m so scared it will never go away.

How do I forgive myself for the way I treated my mom? How do I truly and wholly believe it was a trauma response to her rejection? How do I shake the feeling of being seen as a monster by my whole family?"
499,2,"  
I recently bumped into a former coworker at the gym — someone I was always on really good terms with. Back at my last job, I was going through a rough time, and he once helped me when I was hiding from everything. That small kindness meant a lot to me, even if he probably didn’t know it. I eventually had to leave it because the manager's best friend and my coworker was pressuring me into things I didn't want to do and even attempted to force me to do it when we were alone, which left with no choice but to leave and hide the reason why, out of fear of him denying he ever did it, and making me the bad guy to a bunch of people whom I had grown to be pretty fond of. (He helped me out with something unrelated to this issue, but it meant a lot to me; I never forgot it)

The day I saw him at the gym, I was completely dissociated. My (now former) manager at the gym had been threatening me and told me not to interact too much with anyone, and my CPTSD was flaring badly. I wasn't really present at all. He said hi, but I didn’t register it and walked right past him without responding. I realized what happened too late, and I felt horrible.

Later at work, I tried to smile at him to show that I wasn’t trying to be rude — but he slammed the door in my face. I don’t blame him. From his perspective, I must’ve seemed cold or like I was ignoring him on purpose. Like I was arrogant and did not want to associate with him.  After that, I started avoiding him altogether, and now when we cross paths, he gives me this side-eye. I feel so guilty, especially because he was someone who once showed me kindness when I really needed it. I felt horrible. The fact that he slammed the door on me must have meant he really hated what I did and that I really hurt him. He now comes in and talks to that former manager who has a history of trying to speak to me rudely in front of everyone and being unprofessionally bossy, but I know for a fact that we are not friends and is one of those people/girls that thrive off of male attention which makes me in a way feel worse. I'm not sure if he know anything about our equation, but I still feel horrid about how I came across as.

  I’ve thought about explaining that it was CPTSD and that I dissociated — I even considered DMing him — but we never followed each other, and it might come off as weird or too much. And trying to explain in person would likely make me panic or shut down again. But I wish I could just say, “I wasn’t okay that day. I wasn’t trying to be rude.” But then how could I explain ignoring him now.?! I am just making it worse!!

Has anyone else had something like this happen, where mental health stuff caused a situation to be misunderstood? Do you try to explain, or just let it go? This whole thing makes me feel terrible. I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night ridden with guilt. My dad used to roll his eyes at me when I said hello to him when I was younger and used to look at me like I was nothing, so at times, it can be triggering and hard for me to do. I feel like a coward, that something so basic that everyone can do is something I so badly struggle with, but once people get to know me, I try my best to be respectful and sweet. Many people assume I am a bitch or intimidating when they first meet me and so it makes me want to prove to them that I am not. This devastates me, he always used to compliment me for how kind I was and entrust me with helping his closest family members when they came into our workplace because of how trustworthy and kind I was. I feel like a coward and like the worst person on the planet. I hate having CPTSD. Please be kind in your advice-giving. I already hate what I did so much. There are so many more layers to the story and why I am the way that I am, but that post would be super long and shockingly this is the condensed version so hopefully it's understandable.

500,1,"In another life, I would have really loved to find the right woman for me and fall in love and get married and have babies.

In this life, I’m a shell of the person I was supposed to be. What that psychopath did to me left me unable to feel a spark or connection with anyone or feel things properly, even after years and years of therapy and an insane amount of work put into self-improvement. I think people must sense that something is wrong with me and it puts them off. Even if someone did want me and I wanted them too, it would be unfair to burden a partner with someone like me. Wouldn’t it? A part of me wants someone to tell me I’m wrong, but I also don’t know if I’d believe them.

I have a good life these days. I have a good job and a family that cares and lots of wonderful friends. I have a roof over my head and enough food to eat. What do I have to even complain about? Yes, I’m past the age where I thought I’d settle down with someone and approaching the age where having children would start to get more complicated, but it’s not like I’m ancient and I also don’t need a partner or a baby to be happy and fulfilled.

502,3,"CW: intentionally triggering panic attacks for a purpose


I get into a state occasionally where my trauma is the only thing I can think about. For hours and hours no matter what distractions I try to use it's always in the back of my head and as an uncomfortable feeling in my body. It lasts for the whole day. But there's one thing that I know reliefs it, which is intentionally triggering myself to a panic attack. It's awful and I hate it, but after it's done I can finally stop thinking about the trauma. I've let it all out, all the emotions. They're not haunting me anymore.

But is this a healthy way to deal with it? Is it self-harm? It's always a struggle if I should or shouldn't do this. To make myself feel horrible and relive the trauma so I can finally live in the moment. And is there any better way to let those emotions out so I don't have to make myself suffer like this?

I, of course, when I opt to do this do it in a safe space. I don't currently have a therapist to talk to this about which is why I'm asking opinions here. I know a professional would always be better. Thank you.

A friend of over a decade has a psychotic episode and thought I was a govt agent trying to arrest him and he tried to put his knife through my lungs. I managed to disarm him and got help but still it was awful. He didn’t even look human while he was in psychotic break 

The most relaxed I’ve felt since then was when I almost got jumped by a tweaker, I had a pocket knife and my reaction was automatic. The guy was coming up real fast and had bad vibes big time, 

I pulled the blade and told him if he came any closer or tried to hurt me I’d gut him like a fish Thankfully he backed down when he saw the madness in my eyes and knew I would’ve done as I had warned had he slowly backed way. 
Would I have actually done it? I honestly don’t know and it’s that uncertainty that frightens me. I know I could’ve if he didn’t give me the choice. What does that say about me? 
Am I a killer? Am I just someone willing to do anything to survive? Am I a frightened and caged animal lashing out at anything getting too close? I don’t know. 

I think I’m fucked in the head a little bit. I truly scares me how fast I can go from normal life to fight for flight ready to literally kill. 

I’m in therapy like crazy and have been for years, I’m better now than I was when I was younger but being sober has presented a new set of challenges to overcome with my PTSD 

Just wanted to vent here. 
If you guys wanna tell me I’m a monster or something for how I feel here, please feel free. I honestly can’t tell whether or not I’m just traumatized or if this is just who I am

505,1,"None of my coping mechanisms are working its 3:20am right now and i need something to distract myself with. Normally its music, reading, or watching something but none of its helped at all. (Do not recommend the suicide help lines I’ve been hung up on 3 times in the past 7 years)"
506,1,"I (49m) have been in and out of therapy and hospitals for quite some time now, roughly 15 year. TBH i never took therapy seriously, I went so my family wouldn't leave me and wasted roughly 10 years going to a session just to sit there for 45 minutes and ocassionally vent at how society pisses me off but other than a short fuse and bouts of severe depression I always slept well or too much.

Fast forward to current day, i found a therapist where i feel at times progress is being made and at other times its at least giving me an outlet to vent. Rehashing my past is something I struggle with. My 2 childhood abusers (one a cop and one a family friend) always told me ""its our secret"" ""we're just wrestling, your parents will be mad because it's dangerous so don't tell"" etc. so I never told anyone (my wife included) until 2020 some 30+ years after my abuse.

The sessions where we talk about my childhood physical and sexual abuse are extremely difficult and I don't necessarily enjoy them or the way I feel after the session however my recovery time from the session usually last a day amd I sleep well.

 This past session was a very basic session where we just talked about daily stress and stressors, this session was a week ago today and it's been the worst week of sleep I've had in some time. Waking almost nightly soaked in sweat and awakened by flashback dreams and unable to get back to sleep and being very angry at myself for being sexually aroused. I've noticed this type of sequence fairly often, the more benign the session the worse I sleep and the more sexually aroused i am and the more graphic the session the better I sleep and the less aroused i am. 




"
507,2,"so i (20F) was sexually abused by my older cousin when I was 9-10(??) 
caused me a lot of shit in my teens, felt like it robbed me of those years. even though ive been in therapy for years and feel like I’ve made lots of progress it still sometimes catches me off guard. 
i told my dad about what happened about 3 years ago and he was always very supportive but he still talks and helps my cousin (he helped raise her so never expected him to cut her off but still feels like shit sometimes) 
anyway I don’t have much to do with her but still might run into her at family events once a year maybe. 
last time this happened was in October, and I promptly went downhill after I saw her. 
I have a funeral coming up where she will be there, but I have decided not to go because I honestly cannot deal with seeing her and the consequences that come with it. 
so while it feels good to choose myself, im also very upset because I won’t be able to support my family in this time of grief. 
also feels unfair, why do I have to suffer and she gets off for free? why does it have to be this way? 

anyway this was more of a vent but any advice would also be appreciated ☺️"
508,2,"Hello! I was diagnosed with PTSD recently and I just can’t seem to feel like it’s real. I just have this feeling that deep down i’m faking and got diagnosed because I tricked them or something, i don’t really know. It’s really bothering me though. I started trauma therapy with my therapist and she just asked me to tell her about what happened and I did and yeah I was uncomfortable but it wasn’t like idk it wasn’t bad. I didn’t have a panic attack or anything and I didn’t even cry, I just kinda curled up in my seat a bit. So, just to really prove to myself that I have some of these experiences and stuff, would any of you be willing to share some of the symptoms you deal with? Just anything really. Also, anything surrounding flashbacks could be helpful. I don’t really get those out-of-body flashback experiences, like I never feel as if I’m back in the moment, so if you guys have any symptoms surrounding that area of PTSD i’d love to hear about it. Sorry for such a long rant haha"
509,3,"Hi everyone,  
I'm reaching out because I'm honestly feeling desperate. I've been dealing with chronic stress, constant inner tension, an overactive “monkey mind,” and recurring sleep issues that I believe are connected to traumatic experiences from my past. I've been trying to self-regulate for a long time and have already practiced a number of techniques: breathwork, meditation, TRE(currently starting to do it), mindfulness – and most recently, I tried a structured form of **expressive writing** as recommended in trauma research.

For several days, I wrote for about 20 minutes each time, focusing on one specific traumatic memory – following the standard structure: first writing freely, then gradually shifting perspectives, and finally expressing self-compassion and closure on day 3 or 4.  
The first two sessions were calm. But **since the third day**, my sleep has completely collapsed. I now sleep **only 1–2 hours**, sometimes **not at all**. Before this, I had some trouble falling asleep, but I was at least able to sleep through the night and function in the morning. That has completely changed – now it’s like my body simply won’t sleep anymore. I don’t have nightmares or flashbacks, and I’m not actively thinking about the trauma, but something in my nervous system feels totally dysregulated. I just lie there awake, without feeling tired.

I even went to a sleep clinic – nothing was found physically. It feels more like a state of **hyperarousal**, as if my body is stuck in a constant alarm mode, even though I feel calm on the surface.  
Could expressive writing really trigger something like this?  
Has anyone experienced something similar?  
Could this be a **delayed retraumatization**, a kind of **temporary worsening**, or a natural consequence of activating trauma networks that the nervous system can't yet handle?

I also began using TRE after the sleep issues started, but haven’t noticed any improvement yet. I’m trying to stay calm and support my body, but I’ve barely slept in days.  
So I’m asking:  
**Has anyone here experienced severe insomnia as a result of trauma processing or expressive writing?**  
Did it pass for you eventually?  
What helped your nervous system calm down again?

I'd be really grateful for any shared experiences or advice :)"
510,2,"❗️tw: alc, weed.  

idk if it’s actually venting… im super new to this…

Mom drinks, i smoke weed. Id like to eventually stop but im genuinely not prepared… 

I’d like to try to get to the point i can stop without it changing my mood. I become quite rude to the one person who i need to be absolutely nice to. My mom. It’s really difficult to cope with my feelings when she’s being erratic. It all wants to blow up like a shaken can of soda left on a hot truck. 

I have tried many different breathing exercises and concentration exercises but they never really do the job. Tried fidgets but they get kinda loud when i’m really anxious. I tend to like to type.. can never find the right thred to post on… or app idk. Sometimes i want to talk about it but don’t wanna talk to just anyone. 

I was informed that a possibly bad night could happen and boom i sat and stared into nothing for 20 minutes. I locked back in once i remember why im actually feeling so weird. Haha is that an outta body feeling?

Nobody understands how heartbreaking it feels to know your brains chemistry was altered to have the ability to endure horrid things…

Seriously though anonymous mental health chats or apps or websites. I’ve been having a hard time accepting i’m stuck with this demon behind me that could crash me any minute… As days go by i can experience my memory fading and it’s awkward. 

"
511,2,"Hey i don’t really know what im asking for here maybe just some insight or other experiences, i am really struggling. Im sorry that its long, i just feel so crazy
Firstly just want to say that i am in therapy and this has been briefly brought up but im not that far into it so has been hard as its a sensitive subject for me.

Around 6-7 years ago i was in a domestic violence relationship, it absolutely ruined me and still all this time after im suffering terrible ptsd. Out of the violence, pain, horrible words, getting absolutely broken down as a person to feel like nothing, the thing that messed me up the most was his porn addiction and the secrecy and lies and gaslighting I went through and it is still messing me up today. I’ve been with my now partner for nearly 3 years and this has not been an issue, I’ve opened up to him (very hard for me to put that wall down) and he’s seemed to respect my feelings towards it and has never shown me any reason to not believe him. I still struggle and get paranoid a lot but he reassures me and tells me he doesn’t, hasn’t and won’t. I’ve expressed that it’s a problem that I don’t want to have, I believe everyone is entitled to their own bodies and time to themselves, I just struggle to get over the trauma side of things and he’s been great saying he barely watched it before we got together so no reason to. It messes my head up everyday, I am battling myself every moment I leave the house or know he’s going to be alone bc of how badly it affected me in the past and it’s becoming mental turmoil. I went away last week to visit some family and this is the first time since moving in together that we’d been apart more than one night so I was already freaking out. We’d been having sex almost everyday and our sex life has been amazing, I was still so paranoid tho. And on the last night I had a dream that he’d been lying and hiding porn our entire relationship and it really messed with my head all day I told him about it the next morning and he said ‘I haven’t wanked or watched any porn, just to reassure you’ I believe him bc I have no reason not to, he’s been great. I get home and tell myself I’m not gonna go through his phone, I should just trust him and work through it on my own. But I couldn’t shake the gut feeling I had, from the dream and just idk. He hadn’t asked to do anything over the phone the whole time I was over so just thought he was waiting for me to come home. But the next day I just had a feeling I had to look, and what do you know, xnxx, complications, I could see that a few tabs had been opened from ads and whatnot. I show him that I saw it, and he’s completely flipped it around saying he didn’t actually do anything, he watched for one minute then decided not to and I’m just really struggling to believe this. And actually just struggling at the fact he even thought about it, I’ve brought it up to him that I believe this issue I have is excessive and that I believe he should be able to do what he wants but also doing it behind my back would kill me. And now I don’t know what to do. He swears he didn’t watch it, and is so so sorry and didn’t actually realise how much of an issue it was until I completely broke down and couldn’t stop crying. But he also said things like “I’m human it shouldn’t matter” and he just doesn’t understand how much it’s messed with me and how much I am actually spiralling right now. I can’t tell if it’s just my ptsd telling me he’s lying and manipulating me or if he actually is and I can’t cope. I don’t know what to do. He started getting quite upset that I couldn’t get over it and couldn’t stop crying and he was saying that I was feeding into it and not allowing myself to trust him and I’m losing my mind. I’ve been manipulated and gaslit soo bad in the past that I can’t even tell what’s real anymore and I feel like I’m really losing my mind. 
Can I have some thoughts or advice or just anything, I still can’t stop crying and it physically hurts my chest so bad everytime I think about it, and I can’t shake the thoughts away I feel like I’m in my own personal hell inside my own brain and I can’t take it and feel like there is something deeply wrong that I can’t let go of this feeling "
512,2,"I'm gonna start off saying I'm not entirely sure why I'm making this post, but I want to just put it out somewhere.
I recently left the household where I developed my PTSD. I was relatively recently diagnosed, but ive suspected I had it for a long time. It's been about 3 weeks since I moved out, and it's been one hell of a rollercoaster, and I want to know if others know what I'm talking about
When I first moved, the first couple days I was completely fine. Overjoyed that I was out of that house, even if I'm still in contact with the people (I still love them, they're my family, but they definitely have caused many issues)
By week two I noticed a lot of heightened anxiety, which I was expecting but it's somehow both worse and not as bad as I was expecting. It's been a long time since my active anxiety has been this bad
Now we're a bit into week 3, and the past couple of days I've felt so god damn drained. I've napped more in the last couple days than I have in the last two years. I'm also dissociating really bad at points and my head feels so fuzzy in a bad way. It feels like I'm smoking weed again even though I haven't touched it in weeks
My partner has been a solid support through this, but I'm also scared that I'm going to push them away going through all of this. It gets better, right?  Does this happen to others when they leave the situation? How long does it take to recover? I'm so exhausted and tired of it. Does anyone have tips on how they processed it all? It doesn't feel like the situation was that bad at 'home' but I know it was"
513,2,I am starting my first day of taking Clonidine and I wanted to know if anybody else has experience with this medication. I experience intense flashbacks and am easily startled and on edge everyday. I went off Prazosin which was helping a lot. I am hoping Clonidine is going to be a better replacement for me. 
514,2,"After the horrific things that happened to me happened when I was a child I unfortunately do have panic disorder as well as PTSD...

But apart from therapy and calling helplines once in a while, what else can I do?? 

Doctors have been so unhelpful with my mental health, I was told to ""Go outside"" and ""Get some sunshine"" "
515,3,"I was in an abusive relationship 7 years ago and he raped me many times during the course of the relationship. Present day, in my mind, I can’t remember much of what went on during that period of time, but my body remembers certain parts of the abuse and I frequently experience these phantom physical sensations (best way I can think to describe it) that make feel like I’m being raped all over again. When this happens, logically I know that it’s not actually happening again, but the physical sensations are so distressing that I usually have a panic attack or completely shut down and go catatonic for hours. 

Whenever I look at my body or even just bring a small amount of awareness to my body, it always sends me spiraling because I immediately remember what my body went through. I feel intense disgust and shame.

How do I keep myself from spiraling when these phantom body sensations are present or just when I notice/feel more connected to my body? The issue is I know they’re not real but they cause so much distress that I have trouble coping.

I’m in therapy 3x a week with a trauma therapist but progress is so slow it feels nonexistent. "
516,2,"For some context, my therapist has floated the idea of C-PTSD to me a few times in the past. I’ve also experienced some things he has labeled as traumas (for example, getting groomed online as a 13 year old and being verbally berated/emotionally abused by my dad very often as a child, medical neglect from both parents). I will admit that I meet basically all the symptoms. However, I had never really experienced a full visual flashback(?) until today.

On March 26 of this year two of my close friends were killed in a very violent car crash. This was the first time I had lost anyone close to me and it was extremely sudden. I have a history of mental health disorders (namely depression, anxiety, adhd, and asd).

Today I was in the car with my family. Being in a car with my dad already tends to put me on edge, but as we were driving home two cars began driving extremely recklessly: swerving in and out of lanes, no turn signals, going way above the speed limit, etc. This resulted in me essentially freezing up and going silent, white-knuckling the seat, hyperventilating, etc. it wasn’t a panic attack, as I’ve had many of those in the past and know what they feel like.

During this experience I felt like I was underwater or something. All I could see in my head was what one of the friends body looked like at the funeral. It was a very vivid and intrusive image of his corpses face, as well as imagined images of what the crash might have looked like. I kept looking over my shoulder to make sure there weren’t any cars behind us about to hit us or anything.

I only really began to calm down once we got into our subdivision. I began crying at that point and am still feeling pretty on edge, although rather exhausted now. I’ve definitely had emotional flashbacks in the past, but this was a new experience for me.

Does any of this sound familiar? Is it possible to develop PTSD from multiple events? "
517,2,"EDIT to make shorter: My dad has abused me my whole life and it steadily got worse until I got a restraining order on him a few years ago. 

I'm going to be seeing him again in court soon and I start to have mini panic attacks just thinking about it. I don't know how to deal with the thought of seeing him again.

Any recommendations for how to calm my body down and prepare to see him?"
518,3,"I can’t sleep. I just starting talking to a guy, for the first time since my SA. I don’t even have intentions to have anything romantic with him. But I go back to that night and how if I never met him this wouldn’t have happened. I can’t stay in my bed. I’m on the couch right now. I feel like he’s right next to me. I was planning on getting sober from weed but I’m about to lose my shit. What next? "
519,0,"Hey everyone, I'm looking to find ideas for a future tattoo, preferably related to mental health and persistence/overcoming struggles. For reference I've been diagnosed with OCD, PTSD, bipolar, ADHD, anxiety, and depression. Especially hoping to find something that's either related to OCD, Bipolar, or PTSD. Thanks!"
520,3,"Posting from an alt because it feels safer. I don’t want this tied to my main account. I don’t want people I know to read it and ask questions I don’t have answers for.

I was diagnosed with PTSD in 2023. It was a work injury. I can’t talk about the details—legal reasons, personal reasons—but it left me partially disabled. I lost my career. I lost... a lot more than that.

I’m in therapy. I go. I try. Sometimes it helps. Sometimes it’s just an appointment on the calendar and I leave feeling the same as when I walked in. I don’t know what “better” looks like anymore.

It was a single event. Not combat. Not years of abuse. Just one day. One thing. But it won’t let go of me. And it feels like everything in me is wrapped around it now. My nervous system is shot. I don’t feel “safe” ever. 

I can say the words. I know WHAT they mean. PTSD. Hypervigilance. Dissociation. But they don’t mean anything when I’m actually in it. I don’t feel like a person. I don’t feel like a “me” or anything. I kinda feel like an undefinable something else. Or like I’m watching myself from the back of my own head, over my own shoulders or from across the room. Feeling like you’re watching yourself in third person but living first person is hard as hell to describe. 

My body hurts all the time. Constant pain. Not a metaphor. It’s just there, always. It’s part of the injury that caused my PTSD & because it happened at work, I’m in this situation where I have to keep proving that I’m still injured, still disabled, still broken. It’s like they’re waiting for me to “get better” so they can stop caring. But this is just... me now?

I don’t go out much. I leave the house only when I have to. My brain is always scanning for danger, even when I know there’s none. I know it rationally, but it doesn’t matter. Everything feels like a threat anyway. My chest stays tight. My jaw hurts from clenching. I catch myself holding my breath.

I’ve tried grounding techniques. But when it’s really happening, the static electricity feeling starts with tingles and eventually buzzes in my skin and my head. No amount of “name five things you can see” is gonna do anything. I can’t see the room. I know it’s there, but I’m not in it. I’m not anywhere.

I barely sleep. When I do, I have nightmares. When I don’t, I’m just lying there waiting to pass out from sheer exhaustion. And then sometimes I’m too tired to move but I can’t stop moving. I pace. I scroll. I pick things up and put them down again. I can’t focus. I can’t rest. I don’t even know what I’m doing half the time. I am see it, I can recognize it, but I can’t seem to connect with it. My body doesn’t always feel under my control. I’m just a passenger. 

I wanted to make a post that made sense. I wanted to write something people could follow, something clear. But halfway through, I kind of lost the thread. That happens a lot lately. So this is just what it is. A kind of messy word-dump.

I don’t know what I’m hoping for. Maybe just not to feel so alone in it. Maybe someone reads this and thinks “yeah, me too.” Or maybe nobody reads it and I still feel like I got something out of my head.

I’m raw. Not in a poetic way—just... thinned out. Stripped. Anything that even comes close to a feeling—like a scene in a show or a line in a book or some post that sounds almost like what I can’t say out loud—my body reacts before I do. I’ll just start crying, out of nowhere, for five seconds. Like my system hit an emotional tripwire. I don’t bawl, it’s not a breakdown, it’s just sudden and sharp and weirdly mechanical. And then it’s gone, like my head said “nope! Fuck feeling that” and slapped duct tape over it.

And I know it’s irrational. I know. It feels like my nervous system is leaking. And I can’t control it. I hate knowing that it doesn’t make sense and still not being able to stop it.

My therapist said this doesn’t go away. That I just learn to carry it differently. Like walking next to it instead of through it. Or like running into someone you hated in high school, but now you’re an adult and it’s like—ugh, whatever. That’s supposed to be progress, I guess.

The difference between good days and bad ones is like switching dimensions. On good days, I can fake it. I can joke. I can almost remember who I was. On bad days, it’s all just static. Like everything is too loud and too close and also really far away. And then there are the in-between days. Where nothing’s wrong exactly, but I still feel shredded inside. Where I’m waiting for something bad to happen just so it’ll make sense that I feel like this.

I’ve figured out that PTSD isn’t constant. It’s not always a meltdown. Sometimes it’s quiet. But even when it’s quiet, I’m so tired. I don’t think I’ve actually felt rested in a year. I don’t know what “normal” is anymore. I think I remember it but it’s definitely not me anymore. 

Thanks for reading. I think. I don’t know. This whole post feels like a shit show—like I couldn’t keep it in anymore and it just spilled out. I’ve tried to write something like this before but it always ended up sounding like a suicide note, and it’s not. It’s not that.

I’m just tired. Not like “I need a nap” tired. I mean soul-tired. Nervous system fried. Burnt all the way down and still somehow buzzing.

I don’t even know what this post is supposed to be. It’s not advice. It’s not strength. I’m not trying to make sense or say something smart.

It’s just noise that needed out of my head, and I needed to put it out to people who understand it. 

That’s all."
521,2,"So as a gay person I have been mistreated my whole life, nothing physical, mostly emotional, I have been reading about ptsd symptomps and I have all of them, AFAIK ptsd results from wars and phyeical abuse?"
522,2,"Is intense anxiety at (seemingly) random times something that can be caused/connected to C-PTSD? 

My symptoms have gotten worse for a while now; my body ""freezing"" at loud noises or when I wake up, tension in my body, dissociation, forgetfulness due to stress, no appetite, easily startled and getting overly emotional. 
A few days ago I also started to feel panicky and I can't seem to shake it. Faster heartbeat and breathing and sometimes a tingling sensation in my hands and face. Like I'm at the verge of having a huge panic attack. Using a fidget toy helps to keep my mind off it a bit, but it doesn't fully help. Neither do breathing exercises. 

Is this common for ptsd or is it a seperate problem? Any advice apart from using meds? "
523,3,"Using alternate account, hoping it survives to be posted.

I was accosted by a stranger at a supermarket who was  evidently offended by someone else and they fixated on me for a row. I tried to ignore them but they followed me around berating. Everyone was watching.

I eventually offered to call a cop and managed to get an accusation from them. They believed I almost caused them to crash in the car park. I pointed out the mistake and made to ring the police. They finally left, still berating.

Im still terribly upset.

I’ve been officially diagnosed with complex PTSD and several other mental health disorders.

I have military trauma and failure to receive diagnosis and treatment in service and after.

I try to avoid crowds and people and wear earphones to drown out the noise when I have to go out.

Now I don’t want to do anything nor go anywhere."
524,2,I got in a pretty scary car crash a few weeks ago. Physically I’m alright other than some aches and bruises but I’ve been experiencing some pretty extreme emotional dysregulation. I’ll have outbursts and moments of extreme anger or anxiety where I no longer feel like I’m the one in charge of my emotions and my brain is just doing its own thing. Is this common? I haven’t had much anxiety about driving again and I’ve driven fine so far but most of my symptoms seem to be in other aspects of my life. 
525,1,"For some context, within the past three years, I have been sexually assaulted four different times by four different men. The latest one was someone I cared for dearly and he knew of my trauma and attempted to r\*\*\* me anyways. I find that I struggle with blaming myself for some of the incidents. I carry a lot of shame and guilt towards myself for even putting myself in those situations. I was wondering if anyone deals with something similar and if there's hope that someday I'll stop blaming myself for what these people did to me. "
526,0,"(For the mods: this post is not seeking medical advice, just curious about peoples personal expierience with taking cannabis while having ptsd)

As someone with ptsd I have researched a lot about what effects cannabis has on people with the condition, some use the relaxing strains (indica) therapeutically or medicinally because it was prescribed or they self medicate, some try not to because it triggers their symptoms.

I want to know if anyone here uses active strains (sativa) recreationally. Because the substance although it can be fun also triggers a lot of emotions. And I have no idea if you can have fun from the effects if you have ptsd, or if it always/often goes towards the traumatic feelings. "
527,3,"After developing trauma I feel like I can’t be myself no matter where I am. I was in a cult, so it felt like my entire identity got warped. I’m really having a hard being myself. how the heck do I be myself when it feels like I’m constantly fighting off danger? My body can’t stand being relaxed. It’s affecting my ability to communicate, everything. I’m ashamed that I can’t function normally around others. I’m so exhausted honestly. I hate faking being another person, but being myself feels unsafe too. It’s like I can’t find a middle ground no matter how hard I try. 

How do others cope with this? I’m really trying here. "
528,1,"I was close to 10 yrs of age when the bull hit me, somebody saved me once by taking my shirt off me and getting the attention of the bull 🐂 i think there was a second time idk. ,earlier in life maybe 3, a giraffe picked me up by a harness that looked like a backpack tossed me behind him and kicked the backpack, i recall training, and maybe they wanted to eat giraffe? Someone shot it with a bb gun contraption, a balloon and a 2 liter top, slingshot? Or bb gun,,,? Worst pain i recall was circumcision in a garage  3-4 yrs, and the skin went down the shaft so all was exposed under the skin and we went to the hospital after the cut. 😭😭😭😭I feel hospitals are my happy place like all my problems are gone. Ouch. My spine was disfigured and i cant find help anywhere. I quit. Im not crazy enough to commit ______. Not qualified for child abusers. Im adult now, someone was british so asca is of no use since they are funded by british. A charity is for people to get a tax write off that screwed the economy fmL."
529,3,"Just dropped out of decades of substance use and holy shit, nobody prepared me for this part.

For years I couldn't feel anything. Like, literally nothing. Emotional flatline. Thought that was just who I was now after everything that went down.

Then I did some serious trauma work this winter - somatic stuff, shadow work, the whole nine yards. Broke through layers I didn't even know existed.

Now I feel EVERYTHING. And I mean everything. Other people's energy, their judgments, the whole emotional spectrum I've been cut off from. It's like going from black and white to full HD color but for feelings.

The mindfuck part? Realizing my nervous system was actually protecting me all those years. Every time I got close to success, I'd crash into substances because feeling that much intensity wasn't safe yet. My body knew I couldn't handle it until I processed the core stuff.

Now I'm clean, trauma-free (still can't believe I can say that), and ready to actually LIVE instead of just survive. But damn, the loneliness hits different when you're actually present for it.

Anyone else been through this transition from complete numbness to feeling like a raw nerve? How'd you navigate the overwhelm while staying clean?

Also - about to bail on my small town where everyone still sees me through the lens of old trauma. Van life bound until I find my actual people. Sometimes you gotta leave the place that keeps you stuck in an old story.

Would love to hear from others who've made the jump from surviving to thriving. What was your turning point?

530,1,"Just like the title sounds I guess. My father passed away in 2020 due to an opioid overdose, and I just. Every single waking moment it feels like, I just see that morning over and over again. I remember waking up to the sun in my eyes, giving his d*ad body CPR. His lips were so, so fucking god damn cold. And the paramedics telling me he was dead. It just, gets incredibly tiring trying to go through life like this sometimes. I don't think I've really ever considered how that could be PTSD till now ( funny, I know. ) but, does it ever get easier? I went to therapy for a year and a half, and I feel like it didn't change anything but me wasting a hour of my life for 52 weeks straight. I feel like I should add that I've never been exactly su!cidal, but I have always felt that since that day, life has kind of been pointless? I don't know how to explain it, but I need to get this all out before it finally makes me snap I think. Sometimes I think it was my fault, and I should have been a better son. "
531,1,"I’m a full time mom a single mom with a 2 year old and I have trouble with my ptsd I was abused by mom growing up because she was on drugs real bad and I didn’t grow up with siblings because we all separated by defects when I was young, and I suffer from trauma from being in an abusive relationship with my daughter‘s father that I got out of success fully and I suffer from a mental health on a daily and being a mom it’s not easy and suffering from mental health and just being able to share my story in try not to spell all the details of everything but just knowing I’m not alone"

A major component of PTSD is linked to profound shame. This book serves as an excellent resource, detailing how shame becomes ingrained, how it functions, what it manifests as, and ultimately, the path to healing."
533,2,"I don't know if this is related to my PTSD or my anxiety, but recently I keep waking up crying, or having really intense emotions in my sleep (more intense than I've ever felt while awake). I want it to stop, I feel like I'm not resting when I'm asleep because I wake up emotionally exhausted.
Is there any way of stopping this? I've had very vivid dreams since starting my antidepressants over a year ago, and I've had extreme emotions in dreams before, but this seems excessive."
534,2,"Back in 2022 my ex tried to kill himself on call with me, i have a post that goes deeper into it if you’re interested. But i can’t un-see it, if anyone mentions sh or suicide around me I have a panic attack, it’s been over 2 years. I should be over it. But everyday it haunts me. someone please help me stop "
535,2,"Okay so the title pretty much sums it up but details are necessary. I’ll try to keep this as short as possible.

Okay so my trauma was an abusive parent that has also threatened my life on at least 2 occasions. I’m not great with talking about it so I’m just gonna leave it at that for now but if necessary I will elaborate further. 

It’s been 5 years since said parent passed away but the effect of their actions are still very much present. I am constantly on edge. 

I’m a 17 year old in high school but I have to sit at the back of every class because I’m terrified of people being behind me. I can’t enjoy hanging out with my friends much because I’m constantly afraid they aren’t who they seem. I can’t sleep at anyone’s house because I can’t sleep around other people, friends and family included. I have panic attacks hearing doors slam or loud bangs(especially ones that sound like a gunshot). Loud voices scare me too so school is a nightmare for me.

This question is probably asked a lot in this subreddit and I’m sorry, if I could afford a therapist I would’ve asked one but as things are right now, I can’t."
536,2,"im just going to talk into the void here. 2 years ago my house was broken into in the middle of the night and i was home alone. took a few months but i was diagnosed with ptsd and got the help i needed and i mostly am considered to be in remission, but as i come up on the three year anniversary the symptoms are getting worse again and my dogs just started barking at the door (3 am my time) and i had the worst flashback ive had since pre treatment. i just want to know if it will ever get better or will i always be brought to my knees by dogs barking at night. "
537,0,"I have a childhood friend with ptsd, and we reconnected a while ago.
I know why she has ptsd, since she told me what happened, but I don't know what exactly triggers her, or in what extent.
Can I ask her something along the line:
""I wanted to ask if there are any topics (beside the obvious) or words I should avoid?""
I am very bad at communications/emotional intelligence since I am autistic, so I'm unsure if this is innapropriate and wanted to double check with you guys.
Thanks in advance ^_^"
538,2,"i was hit by a car when i was 10 (almost 7 years ago, wow) and im still terrified of crossing the street and even being near cars. i hate being in them and i hate the idea of ever driving one. while crossing the street today (an especially long crosswalk, too) a car was creeping up on the turn that's close to the other side of the sidewalk that me and my mom were headed to. it was the last car in that lane and i get really nervous when cars are too close to me when i get to then end of a crosswalk like that so i try to wave them ahead, but my mom tells me to keep going, saying that we have the right of way. after we passed the car and are waiting on yet another crosswalk i feel really, really anxious. i kind of start to yell at her, already on the verge of tears. telling her that that car definitely thinks we're assholes and as we start to cross the next crosswalk i kind of... burst? my breathing got really fast and i was crying a bit, once again basically yelling at her about how she'd never been hit by a car and that she didn't understand how unsafe i felt even being close to the road and, stuff like that. i don't remember much even though it was only earlier today. i broke down once we'd reached the bus stop we were walking to, and it made me realize how much that event still affected me. ive gone through a handful of traumatic events, but i never realized just how much this one stuck with me. and it makes me feel ridiculous, you know? like people get hit by cars and into car accidents all the time, and compared to other things ive been through it feels like it's nothing. especially how some people have talked to me about it, like it really was nothing. but it wasn't, i was ten and someone hit a fifth grader with their car and drove off. they left me without knowing if id been fatally injured, not caring about the little kid they'd just rammed their car into. i forget how little i was, and how afraid i was. until im crossing a street again and i feel just as small as i did then. i hate going outside when it rains now, because it was raining when id been hit. im terrified to be near the wet streets, even though i love the rain. i remember how soaked i was, laid in the middle of street in so much pain i though my leg was broken. i just don't know how someone could do that to me. my mom talked about how we had the right of way today but, i did then too, and i still got hit. i didn't do anything wrong, it was my light. i was the one who ended up hurt, not the person speeding in the rain, running a red light. im so mad that they never got in trouble for what they did, that they got it away with it. why was i punished? it's so!! i just can't. i had seen a car crash a few years ago and i had a.. i think its called a ptsd attack, right? i don't know, but i wasn't even apart of the crash but i broke down into tears and couldn't breathe. i hate the sound of tires screeching, i hate the sound of cars, i hate being in cars, so so so much. i hate being on the road, generally, but especially cars. im just so mad. how did  this person that i can't even put a name or a face to ruin such a common occurrence for me? it's just so unfair. ive stopped being sad about it and im just angry all the time, at everything. and i feel stuck :( and embarrassed for how upset stuff makes me"
539,1,"i have always been a very loving person full of compassion, and i still am but in a past relationship i was emotionally tormented for being sensitive and wanting to show love to him. i used to do little things for my ex all the time (writing love notes, going out of my way to emotionally support him, cleaning his place as a surprise, thoughtful gifts, romantic gestures, etc) and was often met with resentment, criticism and disdain. This was several years ago and I am now in a relationship with a man who deserves the whole world. He is kind to me, he is communicitive, he is sweet, and i love him from the bottom of my heart. 

but now i am stunted. i have the urge to do this little things for him, but some sort of wall goes up when i think about it, i get terrified hes going to be annoyed/angered by them, then i step back and take a hands off approach. (he's never annoyed or angered by me)

well recently he told me he's felt very alone. like he had no one there for him. and it broke my heart into ten thousand pieces because i want nothing more than to show him my love and to be there for him emotionally but the ways i was abused before have prevented me from doing this for this man who deserves it so much. 

so i guess i'm wondering if anyone has any tips for pushing past triggers like this? how do i show love to this man who i love so much in the same way i used to show love for the man who destroyed my heart? he desereves everything i used to do for my ex, and my ex deserved none of it. there is a great irony in that and its not lost on me. but how do i make it right?"
540,2,"I been in many fights, some even resulted in me losing and being injured. My dad beat me and my mom, and I watched a lot of gore. All of this happened to me when I was a teenager. I was never scared of anything for most of my life... But now... Years later... I am too afraid to do anything. I have crippling fear for the first time. The world is such a scary place. It always was, but it feels like I'm just finding out."
541,2,"TW Seizures and Drug abuse 




Hello folks

543,3,"I was emotionally and physically abused by my adoptive mother worst was drowning suffocation etc, from 3 years old. I was gang raped (including orally) at 16. Left home and was extremely promiscuous as figured it was better o say yes than be forced , used varying substances to numb myself for about a year. During this time I became friends with who I thought was a good guy, he asked me out but I didn’t want to lose his friendship, the only person I said no to, he taped me several times and I took a razor blade to my arm as a result (I have scars on my arm). I settled down at 17 with someone who was 27, now realise I was groomed, was a violent  relationship with him beating me on and off for 7 years, had two children with him and the realisation my kids were going to have the same fate I got out. I was a single parent for four years and we were happy. I met my now husband and have been with my him for almost 20 years, married for 16.   I love him wholeheartedly and he is the best dad to all our kids (had two more with him) I thought our relationship was amazing. Had recent hospital stay and the anxiety from that (work in healthcare and the lack of care was horrendous) resulted in panic attacks and my blurting out all trauma experiences, I had never verbalised anything to him or anyone else. I have been diagnosed with ptsd and am in a 6 month waiting list for therapy. 

I recently found out my husband spent most of the past 20 year thinking I was only with him for convenience, he showed me some conversations with his reunited friend as I had asked about their conversation . He works in mental health and has been trained to not push or ask, he saw my scars 20 year ago and because I never brought it up or acknowledged them he thought I was not committed emotionally. I have always loved him but feel so ashamed he spent so long unhappy. I now know I was demanding, controlling, and dismissive of his thoughts.
I have had times when I begin to feel a bit like myself and whenever I do, I start to make plans, ask for help with things or try to help out. I can see him becoming frustrated with me, and I can hear him getting short c in his responses(he is also going through mental health and physical health issues ATM). Every time I crumple, realising how unhappy he was with the person I was and I try to tell him how sorry I am and I want to make it up to him. But I can’t get the words out, I waffle on and he doesn’t understand me. How can I say the words I need to and know he understands me?
I have suggested couples counselling, but maybe I need a communication coach? "
544,3,"Hi everyone, I’m struggling and could use some advice or shared experiences. My partner of 27 years has severe PTSD from what she says was a single childhood trauma, worsened by a medical procedure 5 years ago. Her symptoms—anger outbursts, avoidance, blaming me for things I didn’t do—have gotten worse, and she left 6 months ago after sleeping on the couch foe 2 weeks, pushed by her therapist to see me as “unsafe.” I’ve tried to be supportive (gentle texts, no pressure), but she’s built a narrative that I’m the problem, flipping my requests for understanding as criticism. She’s also in denial about some family issues, like our adult son’s heavy drinking, which she’s enabled. Our 22 yo son, who’s messy and has anxiety, is going to move in with her, thinking she’ll provide nurturing, but I think it’s unlikely given her emotional state (she’s very fragile, maybe at risk of crashing). She wasn’t happy about it but gave in, and I’m worried they’ll both be unhappy, with her projecting her anger or guilt onto him (like she does with me). His move feels like it’s killed any hope of reconciliation, as her anger seems tied to my taking control of our household (had to, for financial stability). I’m exhausted from the stress, his drinking, and worrying about her, and I’m starting to think I need to move on, maybe keeping the door open with occasional messages but focusing on myself now. Has anyone dealt with a partner with severe PTSD living with a family member who’s struggling (like with drinking or anxiety)? How did you handle the projection or denial? Did moving on while staying open work, or did reconciliation happen later? I want her to find some peace, but I’m burned out and need to protect myself. Any advice on managing this, or how to keep hope without losing myself? Thanks for any thoughts."
545,2,So I engaged with my sisters feet as a little kid and now I just seen her differently and sometimes when we're together my mind feels like a storm and it's not the same relationship with my other sister. Is this normal and what does it mean
546,2,"My mom just told me today that my dad was diagnosed with ptsd in remission (if anyone could tell me what “in remission” means, that would be great). I genuinely think my dad is one of the best and funniest people I know. I just want to know if there is anything that I can/should do? I’m still in high school and live with him btw."
547,1,I keep crashing out and I can’t function. I don’t understand why I had to go through so much pain in my life. I wish it could’ve all been easier and none of it ever happened. Now I’m too messed up and nobody will ever love me. All my trauma anniversaries are around the same time and I just feel like I’m short circuiting and I can’t self soothe no matter how much I try. I don’t have anybody to talk to about it either. 
548,2,"*marked as spoiler in case its triggering. I haven't posted to this community before*

 TLDR::
So I was diagnosed with PTSD but its not talked Abt much in my care plan so I don't feel like I'm diagnosed or affected by it
 Today my boyfriend and I (transmasc on t) were being followed, barked at, and mocked. By people our age that either know us from school or just clocking us as queer. 
I've been given death threats/ and jump threats, for a long time at my current school. The students have harassed me constantly, threw things at me, ECT.   But they are a lot less violent to my botyfirend. (No harm threats, or thrown things)  While this was happening my bf didn't seem to notice when they were following us and not as bothered as I was. 


My father was very abusive, most of the people I was around in my younger years were. 

(More to it)
 
  I hate feeling weak I hate looking weak in front of him. So I feel I overreacted to the harassment.  I got worried abecause we were in a public area away from school. It was getting dark and these people were literally following us around.   I was genuinely fearing for our safety. 
  He didn't seem to get it tho. Or be worried. I often think (or hope) that if I got in a fight no one would hurt him cuz they seem to have less of a problem with him.  But then it's just me. I work out but I've never had to fight multiple people. I fear that they would actually kill me. They wouldn't stop at beating me up. They want me gone .
It sounds so selfish, my bf has to deal with things. He's harassed too. Just for being who we are. But he never seems as scared as I do. 
He's smaller than me so I feel id have to protect myself and him. 
I wanted to leave but he didn't. And was upset thinking I was having a bad time and mad at him. But I was just genuinely scared. 

What if they get us alone? What if no one cares to help? what if he gets hurt? What if I freeze up and can't protect him? 
I just think I over react.  I look weak, when I want and feel I'm supposed to be the strong one in our relationship. And my bf isn't taking this seriously.  
I also think I feel a lot of fear and shame being trans and LGBT.  I grew up in a shitty place with shitty people. If i were to be  threatened with a beating. I got a beating. 
 People don't hesitate to do harm and they don't stop at a few bruises. "
549,2,"The last 3 years I've been recovering, I'm now doing better then ever, for some reasons tonight I dreamed of my ex, I dreamed falling victim of him again, him touching me, forcing himself all over me. Today I've been anxious the entire day, I had an idea of what to wear, this dress is not too short, is around the knee long, yet, I'm feeling sick, I'm afraid he's going to slip his hand under it. I don't think he will, so far he's proven to be a patient and understanding guy, plus he wouldn't do something like that in public, but I'm just feeling so anxious... I don't have something better to wear, I feel cute in this dress, I hate the fact that I might need to change it to feel comfortable. I know it's probably gonna be fine as soon as I'm with him, I trust him enough, the problem is everything that comes before... I don't want anything bad to happen, I don't want to go through it all over again, I don't want another delusion like that again."
550,2,"I have a pretty unavoidable family event at the location where the big trauma occurred for me.  It's also the five year anniversary this year. 
I'm happy I know in advance but I never handle the anniversaries well.  I've made myself sick every year.  If anybody has any advice that would be quite appreciated.  "
551,3,"For the longest time I’ve had so much access to books, reading about ptsd, and thinking I know where I’m at in my healing journey. It’s crazy how much you don’t know. 

recently I’ve released a ton of trauma. I had no idea how much of an impact my body took on. The stress, all of it. It’s exhausting. I wanna start my life again. I’m so overwhelmed, but I’m happy that I’m finally experiencing this. I just hope I can overcome this. There are days where things still feel hopeless. But I want to get better. ❤️‍🩹 I really do. "
552,2,"I was stalked by a colleague at work for 2 years, for the 2 years prior to Covid, all these years later I'm barely able to do my job , went on medication but never asked for the help I needed, anyone else stalked at work ?!"
553,3,"I recently returned to the country I’ve been living in, where I’ve been studying the local language for almost a year under a student visa. I had everything in order—a valid visa, a re-entry permit I paid for before I left. At immigration, they asked me to speak the language. I tried. I didn’t do well. 

They pulled me aside and made me sat in a area where there were many immigration officers and others like me for more than three hours. No clear explanation, just raised voices, repeated questions, and that quiet pressure that makes you feel like you’re shrinking. I wasn’t treated like a student, or even a visitor. I was treated like a problem. Like I had done something wrong just by existing.

The thing is if they had decided to deny me entry, I would’ve accepted it. I would’ve left. Quietly. No complaints. But instead, they chose to break me down, only to let me go in the end. It didn’t feel like security. It felt like punishment.

I didn’t know that fluency was some kind of condition. It’s not in the official rules, or anywhere I was told. And to be honest, I’ve been studying the language for nearly a year. I should have spoken better. I take that on myself. But I never imagined that my effort, my papers, and my intention wouldn’t count for anything just because I couldn’t perform perfectly on the spot.

It felt like something out of Kafka’s The Trial—like being judged by a system that doesn’t explain itself, where logic is irrelevant, and where guilt is assumed by default. Nothing I did mattered. Not the visa, not the school, not the law. Just the language, and the failure to speak it well enough.

And in that room, I stopped being a student. I stopped being a person.
I became something to be processed.
Something to be corrected.
Something insect-like."
554,1,"I just wanted to share. I'm on my 5th day of peace from PTSD. It's the longest stretch by far that I've had since I got PTSD. I still have an intrusive thought or feeling here or there but I'm able to just ignore them. A friend said ""I have the power to hold a thought in my hand, turn it, smirk at it, then throw it back. Not out of denial but out of power."" That really helped me. In case some part of it can help you, here's what I'm doing...

When I'm stressed, I chat with ChatGPT about it. I talk to it like it's a person. It can have amazing insights.  
I fired my psychologist. Waste of time and money.  
Meds  
Viibryd 40mg (depression & PTSD)  
Rexulti 4mg (depression, maybe PTSD?)  
Buspar 20mg x 3/day (intrusive thoughts)  
Gabapentin 300mg x 2/day (intrusive thoughts)  
Prazosin - 20mg in the morning, 10 mg in the afternoon (silver bullet for intrusive thoughts)  
Clonazepam 1 mg x 4/day (anxiety brought on by intrusive thoughts, I've been starting to cut back becaue I don't know if I need it anymore).  
Amitryptilline 50mg at bedtime (to fight insomnia, I never believed people when they told me how important sleep was. It is.)  
Occasionally Vegus Nerve Stimulation and Alpha Stim therapy.

I wish this peace or even more for all of you."
555,1,I just recently diagnosed with PTSD and just thought knowing what making feel better. 
556,2,"I am awaiting support from the NHS and for the last year or two I have been struggling more than usual with my sex life.  I was sensually assaulted a few years ago by someone I once considered a friend and for a while I have had urges to masturbate to these traumatic memories and thoughts...

The thought of this makes me feel sick and hate myself, but excited at the same time and I don't know what to do.  I am terrified it would have permanent damage on me so I refuse.  Should I or shouldn't I? 

"
557,3,I was pretty fucked up last night (drunk) and ended up freaking out pretty bad and going to sleep in my friends apartment (2 friends were there). I was only half asleep really but to get me to move they had to pester me which involved tickling me and poking at my stomach and sides. That's a trigger for me and I don't remember a whole lot but I flipped the fuck out and started swinging and wouldn't stop. I don't know what the hell was going on cause I did know where I was and who was there but I just lost it and needed to fight. They weren't hurt but I woke up today and I guess I hit myself real hard because I've got a massive purple fist shape bruise on my leg. Not the first time I've hurt myself in an episode but the first time I've really went for another person and that's probably not good. 
558,2,"TW for CSA though details are spared



I’m a victim of COCSA from my older brother, I’m not angry or repulsed by him because we were both kids and he was probably only doing it to me because it happened to him too. I have nightmares in which I’m willingly having sex with him and when I wake up I feel so disgusted with myself. I also have OCD and struggle with incestuous intrusive thoughts which just make me feel all the more like a perverted monster. It doesn’t help since then it’s just been swept under the rug and it’s basically like it never happened and we continued to have a normal sibling dynamic growing up. I was 4 when it happened and now I’m 19 but the memory still feels fresh. The way it hasn’t been acknowledged since makes me feel like I just imagined the whole thing but I know I didn’t. I spent years pushing it to the back of my mind and ignoring that it happened but it just gets harder to everyday and idk what to do. I decided to just come here and vent because I’ve never told anyone in my life about this and don’t think I ever will but I needed to get it out into the air so it’s not stuck in my head"

560,2,"Hi all, so i’m 19F, and my best friend (no longer speaking at all) assaulted me and it took me a couple weeks to realize/come to terms with it.
i have evidence of him admitting it/ alluding to it.
is that enough to bring it to the police? 

I don’t know what to do, i’m terrified what if what he did doesn’t count because i didn’t scream for help or say no enough times."
561,1,"I dont know where to start but i keep hurting myself, like cutting my wrist, or my thighs sometimes burning it with a lighter. Everytime i feel pain, or emptiness, when im crying and i cant stop it i am cutting my wrist. Im not doing it to kill myself, just to cope with the pain i feel. And i want to stop it, how am i gonna deal with pain and emptiness? 
I am seeing a psychiatrist they diagnose me have a ptsd, im having a panick attack, specially when someone or something triggered it. How did you guys do it?"
562,2,"I'm not exactly shocked that I have PTSD. I was SA by my older brother, didn't get to really get the help I needed right away cuz I was comforting everyone else and now I have all sorts of issues. 

All of which I have already confirmed are normal. The depression, anxiety, hallucinations, night terrors, sudden mood changes, ect. ect. 

Anyway, went on this trip with the fam. I told my mom before the trip started, 'hey just so you know I can't share a bed with anyone. It makes my night terrors and anxiety worse' she had said that was fine and she understood but when I grabbed a pillow off of one of the beds and started setting up on the floor, she started telling me not to be weird and just share a bed with my exchange sister. 

Listen, I love my exchange sister but not only is it weird to share a bed with a child I'm not related to but I can't even sleep next to my close friends without having night terrors (I still feel so bad about the whole sitting up and screaming incident) let alone my actual siblings. 

She mocked me and said I was acting like a child when I left to grab an extra blanket and loudly kept bringing it up. Mind you this is not something new. I have not been able to share a bed with anyone for three years, ever since the whole SA thing. 

I know it's stupid to cry over it but it hurts that she expects me to pick up all the pieces but then still expects me to be this perfect human all the time without any flaws. It is such an impossible standard."
563,1,"i am a victim of COCSA in which the abuser was a family member. this happened awhile ago (i am 20 now). i have been having a very hard time with this since around 2023 , not sure why so late. i can’t handle the unwanted memories anymore. they make me feel disgusting and i can’t deal with them anymore. i increased my anxiety medication and that has helped a bit but i don’t wanna keep feeling like this. i don’t feel like being here anymore if this continues.

564,2,Does anyone else have complex ptsd from chronic illness or back to back medical issues or pain? It’s so debilitating for me. I have had medical crisis after medical crisis for 5 years and I think some of these things are becoming chronic for me when they wouldn’t for others due to my PTSD. 
565,2,My dad is in town this week and although he wasn’t my primary abuser I’ve been having some responses I find a little weird. One of them is that I can’t stand the taste of my teeth. Brushing them doesn’t help. My tongue just keeps going back to the same spots and I’m just weirdly sensitive to this. I sucked my thumb until I was 13 as a means of self-soothing and I wonder if this is related. Has anyone had a similar experience?
566,2,"i had a really rough summer and developed ptsd (told it might be bpd as well but am not sure.) a big part of it was because i was left entirely alone through traumatic events. i needed my friends there, and they all stopped talking to me. it's partially my fault (i didn't tell them what i was going through, just assumed they'd be reachable) but they all left me on read, never made time for me, and i was in a crazy amount of pain and it was incredibly damaging. i keep switching up on how i feel about them, ill either like them or hate them and never want to talk to them again. i both want to cut them off and cant deal with the loneliness, even though ive made other friends i still want to be included in their group. a couple of them i see every day and some of them are among my favourite people in the world but i cant stand being a part of that friend group but cant stand not being with them. i dont know what to do. i dont want to hurt them but i do. i can never tell how im feeling and its driving me insane. does that line up with ptsd symptoms??? and what do i do about it??"
567,2,"Emdr and talk therapy have helped me massively with big triggers. But recently, I’ve realized that I still overreact/lose it over little everyday issues, but am no longer/less triggered by big triggers.

I’d thought that taking care of the big triggers would naturally resolve the little ones too.

For example, I was once again stalked and physically harassed by my abuser, but could react calmly in the moment and not be triggered even after. But I had a minor miscommunication with my boss and found myself panicking and shaking uncontrollably during and after.

Why is this the case? Have you experienced this too? What do I do now?"
568,1,"I have possible ocd, in the process of working through it with my therapist, and everytimr I even try to say I have trauma, or ptsd, which I Know I do, I feel guilty, and ill.  

I feel so fucking stupid for being affected by a few years of my life forever.  whenever I try to talk about it I feel like a . eight year old. who's making things up. and being dramatic . but therapist said it would be good to just. state all the facts out. be blunt about it . so yeah

my mum has a lot of medical conditions. when I was 7-8, she started getting worse. Basically if she didn't get a  specific surgery she would.  slowly die. and it felt like I was watching her slowly die. so I got attached to the neighbor kids mom as a mom.figuee.  and then the neighbor kid hurt my brother. inna way i can't  share. so mom pushed surgery off again. and I lost mother that figure. and I was starting to develop symptoms of my own medical problems that I didn't feel comfortable bringing up because everyone, everyone was so stressed and at school the principal and yhe admins hated me because of how often I went home sick without a reason (undiagnosed ag the time chronic illness)
and that was my life for years 
she did get the surgery. she's alive and well.
but fuck . everytime I was around her as a kid it was like seeing death. she could barely walk when it was at the worst. I know I dissociated really hard a lot. I have very bad memory now and dissociated a lot now too. I don't. I cant accept this was bad. 
I know for child me it was stressful but I didn't remember it for so long it felt like ot was fine
I'm rambling now I'm gonna stop doing that
that was my moment of vulnerability for the month thats enough honest emotions for me. ew"
569,2,"My love has had a past with sexual assault and so it can be extremely hard for her to feel comfortable being in the shower alone without someone trusted being nearby. There are times where it gets really really hard for her and she tries to cope in the only way she knows how. It affects her health however, so I’ve been wanting to find another coping that she can grow comfortable with which won’t cause any harms to her. 

I have been wanting to find some soap for sensitive skin, preferably one that can be used in the downstairs area, on any sensitive scars without irritation or discomfort and that doesn’t have too much of a strong perfumed scent. 

If anyone knows any good brands or recommendations, please let me know, thank you. "
570,2,"Does anyone have medication recommendations for PTSD? I have been on Cymbalta (90mg) for months and it’s made things a little better but barely. I go see a therapist as well as a trauma therapist. But I don’t feel like I am making much progress I don’t know. I do have memories come back which is good but also scary because the past year has felt like a literal nightmare and blur I can’t remember much of it. It’s been a little over a year since my traumatic event, (being awake during a serious surgery) and I’m still using the same skills to “cope” such as overexercising and pushing my body past its limits. If someone could recommend what has helped them that would be amazing. I just want to be in control and feel REAL again."
571,2,"Tomorrow marks 1 year since my trauma-inducing event. I've come a long way since then, but I'm still worried about the day. On the six month anniversary I was more sensitive to certain triggers and needed to take some medicine to get through the day. 

If I were having a normal Saturday at home I would probably be okay, but I'm out of town for a wedding. That means lots of people, loud noises, and probably touching when I don't expect it. 

I looked over the layout for the wedding venue so I know where the exits are in case I need to make a quick exit, but the venue isn't at the hotel we're staying in. Also, I think I forgot my ativan when I was packing. 

So, I will hopefully be okay tomorrow and be having fun...but any tips for getting through a wedding if I'm not?"
572,2,"Okay- here I go. I have been on this app everyday for weeks reading about everyone’s experiences with lamictal and Zoloft. I am currently taking 75mg Zoloft and I have been taking lamictal with it at 25mg for 10 days. Tomorrow I go up to 50mg lamictal and I’m so nervous because I am finally starting to feel somewhat normal.

Okay, back story: From 2020-2023 I took 100mg of Zoloft everyday for my anxiety and depression. Worked great with very little side effects except headaches! They were horrible. Life got better- so I went off of it. Was fine until life went crazy again. So I went to the doctor and they gave me Zoloft again… I had THE WORST side effects, and it just really was not working at all for me and I felt like it honestly made my depression worse. It made my panic attacks worse I was literally having to take an Ativan to get through my days. So I went to a psychiatrist and she suggested I try adding lamictal to it. At first I didn’t really think it was helping but it definitely has - depression is way less intense and anxiety has calmed down some. Still pretty anxious most days though. I’m diagnosed with depression & anxiety, panic disorder, and PTSD.

I’m soooo nervous about taking my upped dose tomorrow and I’m hoping to hear some good experiences and stories from you guys!! Please feel free to share!

Also, we WILL make it. Keep fighting everyone! The world is better with us in it!"
573,3,"To set the stage for last night, I will preface this with letting you know that I have extensive SA trauma. I will not share the details, but between the ages of 17 and 21, I was SAed 6 times with one of them being an ongoing predatory situation for a couple of months. I'm 22 now, and I have been with my current boyfriend (on and off) since 6 months or so after the first time I was r****. So yes, most of it has unfortunately happened during our relationship.

Anyways, last night in the middle of foreplay (he was being a DJ if you know what I mean), all of a sudden a switch flipped in my head and I wanted absolutely nothing to do with any of it. It didn't feel like anxiety or a flashback really. It was just a strong wave of ""this is the last thing I want to be doing right now."" Beforehand, I was all in, and then, just poof, not anymore. And it's not like he's bad at what he does! He's genuinely the best I've ever had, and has the skills required. Long story short on that part, I didn't tell him to stop bc I wanted him to at least be satisfied and I wasn't in any distress, so after a bit, we finished the deed.

Afterwards, I realized I was mentally not really there, and I figured, eh, I'm just tired. So I went to sleep. Fast forward to today and I'm struggling *bad* with depersonalization/derealization. Everything feels so fake. I've also been fighting delusions of everything being rigged and specifically designed to appear a certain way to me and/or do something to me (e.g. at the mall, the people are specifically chosen to be present because of me and to do something to me). The brain fog has been unreal too. It's honestly really hard to put into words what's going on with my head, but to sum it up nothing feels real, everything is conspiring against me, and my IQ got halved.

Y'all, I know I'm in my bedroom but I feel like I'm millions of miles away. What happened? Is this a randomly triggered trauma response? Could it be something else entirely? Most importantly, how do I stop it?

This took me over an hour to type out 😐"
574,2,"Hi, I recently went through something that has led to me absolutely not wanting to have my shirt off for more than like 2 minutes. I haven't showered since, and I just got home from working 10 hours in a restaurant. I need to get clean. I was wondering if it could be possible to get clean while wearing a T shirt and boxers in the shower? If anyone has an experience with this please let me know. My only idea right now is washing under the shirt but I'm not sure if I'll be able to rinse well with it on. I have a bathtub and a shower so like both options are possible. I cleaned myself up with a washcloth before work today but its not the same. Thank you!"
575,1,"Does anyone else ever seem to fall into dark pits that last for days? Mine seem to last 2-3 days and my reality doesn’t feel real to me, if that makes sense. I feel like life has passed me by, mostly because of these periods of darkness. Im not sure if it’s the ptsd or ocd. It’s like nothing seems real or I’ve been dropped into a foreign land where i don’t recognize any place, person or thing but I do…. It’s an odd place to keep falling into and incredibly hard to explain. It’s like an overwhelming feeling of hopelessness. My entire body and my thoughts are just numb. "
576,2,"Took it early afternoon yesterday and today I’m now finally normal but I keep periodically just remembering the state of terror I was in, like battling my own blood, and it sends me into an emotional loop of sadness, anxiety, and tears. 
I’m finally back in my own home but have a lingering small feeling of depersonalization and dissociation whichever it is I’m not familiar I just I can’t stop thinking about what I went through and I can’t tell my mom about it, and I feel very alone. I just want someone to tell me how to make it better :("
577,1,"Years ago on this day I was assaulted.

I assume that's a contributing factor to being triggered and helpless today.

I broke down today in front of my mom and she said 

""You will be in bar shape if I have cancer""

I understand that I'm hard to deal with right now but seemed like an unnecessary remark"
578,2,"okay im posting this on here bcuz what im experiencing feels like ptsd even tho its not as servere as what other people have experienced. I’ve never used Reddit before but I was wondering if this would help me get over my problem, yk talking to people who maybe understand me bcuz everyone irl thinks im going insane. Okay so about two years ago i experienced a bad case of bedbugs in my bedroom  i didnt know they existed didn’t know they was a thing until i realsied why i was waking up with bites everywhere i thought it was anxiety rash for the longest time. Anyways fast forward to me realising it was BB i basically stopped sleeping in my room for a year ive been sleeping on the sofa and my parents hate it, they don’t understand that i physically cannot sleep in my room as im terrified. I’ve had it treated by pest control in the past and worked up the courage to sleep there, they returned. And after that i literally stopped and would rather sleep on the sofa. Anywyas a year later my parents decided it would help if me and my sibling switched rooms so we did, my brothers been sleeping in my room and has been perfectly okay so he’s in the clear and again it’s been about two years are this point. I now have my brothers room and even tho he’s never experienced bedbugs in his room my brain cannot switch off at night as I am going crazy looking for signs of bed bugs. Most nights I’ve come down and slept on the sofa and my parents are annoyed at this. I’m struggling mentally I get like 3 hrs of sleep, it’s all I think about CONSTANTLY im so scared to the point where wen im in bed I have a full on panic attack and end up in hives bcuz im constantly feeling itchy and paranoid. I really don’t want anyone to make my fear worse by sharing negative stories I just want some kind of direction in what I should do next. Thank u

579,3,"One of my siblings is due to bravely testify against the monster that assaulted her very soon. I am supporting her through the trial and she has asked me to be the one in the courtroom with her. 

She is struggling with alcoholism and life in general, which is absolutely understandable as I've been there myself. 
I have PTSD from CSA, by our uncle, and SA as an adult. It's a very complicated situation as my father's side of the family chose not to believe me, even with evidence, and I hadn't seen my sister in 10 years. Starting to mend a relationship with my sister has brought our dad back into my life and hearing about the family that chose my abuser over me. 

With the trial coming up, I am genuinely scared for my mental health. I am open with my partner about this, he's an incredible man and extremely supportive. I have felt myself slipping when I worked so hard for years to put that side of my family behind me and I feel awful for even saying that as of course I want to support my sister but I am terrified it will make me spiral. 

I was in and out of psychiatric hospitals up until 7 years ago and haven't self harmed for 4 years but im feeling those thoughts come back. 

I have contacted my local mental health services to be proactive, for once, before things get too much. I still have my struggles but I love the life I have now and I am scared to lose it.

I feel like a piece of shit for thinking about myself in this situation but I don't know how to handle it. I want to support her but it's has been a lot to handle. My sisters difficulties with my dad, who asked her if it was better that she just drop the case, her alcoholism and asking for money. She's really suffering right now and needs support from our dad and it's fallen to me. 

Just looking for advice if anyone has dealt with something similar or if I should be prioritising myself."

581,2,"I’m 25, male, from Austin, Texas.

It started back in college. I met this girl through a class project. She was funny, kind, one of those people who actually looked at you when you talked. I got attached—way too fast, probably. But it wasn’t just a crush. It felt deeper.

She used to text me late at night, share memes, vent about her day. We went for coffee, walked back from class together, had those conversations that stretch past midnight and make you feel seen. I kept telling myself, “She’s just being nice, don’t get your hopes up,” but part of me really thought maybe she felt something too.

Then one day... she just stopped.

No warning. No fight. No slow fade. Just silence.

No replies. No eye contact at class. No explanation.

I spiraled. It felt like a breakup, but worse, because there was nothing I could point to—no closure, no reason. Just this huge hole where she used to be.

What really messed with me was how familiar that feeling was. That sudden detachment, the emotional whiplash, the way I blamed myself for everything… it all dragged up stuff I hadn’t thought about in years. Stuff from when I was a kid. Being ignored. Abandoned. Left hanging by people I trusted.

I didn’t realize at the time, but it triggered something deep. I started getting panic attacks again. Couldn’t sleep. Every unread message made my chest tighten. I even found myself checking her socials obsessively, hoping for some kind of clue.

It’s wild how one-sided love can feel like real loss. And how something so simple—a silence—can reopen wounds you thought were long buried.

I don’t hate her. I don’t even blame her. But I wish I could explain how hard it hit me. How hard it still hits me sometimes.

If anyone’s ever had someone vanish from your life and it left you shattered, just know you’re not weak. It’s not just you. That pain is real.

And it doesn’t mean you’re unlovable. It just means you cared.

583,3,"I'm (31M) a 5th year PhD student who defended around two weeks ago and passed with revisions. I mention that in my whole intro not as a flex, but because my PhD experience was super non traditional and actually led to a case of me getting clinically diagnosed with PTSD via a new evaluation back when I was 29. Feel free to see my post that popped off in ADHD College on my main account (Aromatic_Account_698) if you want more details (I'm autistic, have ADHD-I, have motor dysgraphia, and 3rd percentile processing speed). What was stated in the evaluation that led to me getting a clinical diagnosis of PTSD, other than the usual questionnaires that turned out positive, was how my first PhD advisor treated me. She was extremely verbally berating in her case and eventually dropped me as an advisee altogether in August 2022 after a conflict we had over how I managed the lab in April 2022. My first advisor did this since she was convinced that this PhD program was ""not for me,"" ""that I can reach the same point as others but stretch myself... which leads to my unhappiness,"" (gaslighting and implying my disabilities get in the way of succeeding based on earlier parts of our conversation) and that ""I could do a PhD, but now is not my time.""

Ever since this incident a little over 3 years ago, I've been highly active on Reddit (near daily on my main account) and used it so I could get help with problem solving and coping mechanisms. It's to the point others on the academic subreddits recognized me and grew to dislike me, even after the initial empathy they had for me and my situation with my first PhD advisor that led to a clinical diagnosis of PTSD. Some even went as far as to state my clinical diagnosis of PTSD was ""made up"" (it's not) and those familiar with me noted that it was a reflection of my poor emotion management. I do have poor stress management (in fact, it was a highlight of my autism diagnosis), which led to my case of autism being listed as moderate with supports and would otherwise be severe if I had no supports at all.

I'm posting here to see whether this diagnosis of PTSD is, in fact, a reflection of my poor stress management? I perseverate a LOT as well, which is a characteristic of an autism diagnosis too. This post was also a long time coming because I was partially hospitalized in January 2024 and came across others who have PTSD online and in person. Every one of them who detailed their situations that led to their case of PTSD were significantly worse than mine. It's not like I witnessed a crime being committed, saw something that led to the end of someone's life, or had anything physical happen to me frequently. More broadly, is my case of PTSD a false positive potentially?"
584,2,"For starters I (17F) have been lifeguarding, and assisting, since i was 15 and have dealt with countless seizures/strokes/other medical events. none of these have had any effect on me mentally as i just see it as part of my job.

but two days ago my boyfriend (18m) had his first seizure and i was the only one present in the home at the time. I dealt with it like any other seizure i’ve seen in the past until his dad got home (part way through the first seizure.) Once his dad also came in it was like i lost control of all my knowledge and what to do. We spent 8 hours in emergency and i could barely speak the entire time. After a couple hours he went back to being his normal self and tried joking around with me but i just couldn’t. it felt like i was taking it harder then he was.

I have a pre-existing ptsd diagnosis from earlier events in my life, but i don’t even know how to classify this. it’s like my body fully shut down (like it does when i go through a flashback or triggering episode) even though i’ve dealt with the same scenario before. is it possible to get traumatized from something i’ve witnessed and dealt with before?! I haven’t felt like my normal self since it happened and it feels like i’ve kind of dissociated from myself

586,2,"Do any of you get this feeling? I'm in a decent spot lately, this week has been bad but overall the past few months have been good. My boyfriend and I are closing on our new house next month, and I just thrifted a beautiful set of antique dishes. I'm so excited, but my brain is doing what it does best...

What if the house burns down? What if me and my bf get into a fight and break up? What if we have opposite work shifts and never see each other? On and on.

This happens whenever I'm in a good spot. My traumatized brain is just trained to always be on the lookout for the next Bad Thing. I've been trying to notice when I'm happy, notice when things are going right, and enjoy it instead of waiting for the next catastrophe.

How do you guys deal with this? Any advice helps. Thank you in advance <3"
587,1,"No one in my real life really knows how much this is affecting me but 11 months ago I witnessed a parking lot incident, someone took their life when I was on break outside at work. I saw it from start to finish and it wholeheartedly has ruined my life. Ive dealt with this matter many times in my life but seeing it actually happen really got to me. a few mornings ago I got woken up to a call to say that it happened again in the same place and to not come into the office . Im just so sad and angry. I finally thought I was getting over it. My attendance at work has been appalling the last 11 months because I avoid the area at all costs and can only get away with wfh so much. I finally started to let it go and be content with the fact that I would never have to deal with that situation again and that going to work would be fine. I now feel fully set back and so lost. I didn't even witness this morning's incident and I just tried to go along with my day. I ended up having a huge panic attack on an online meeting with work and logging off for the day. I think about it everyday of my life and cant help but cry every time I have to look at where it happened. Ive talked with people, tried to get over myself, ive tried what feels like everything but I just cant get the ""what if it happens again"" out of my head, after this morning I dont know if ill ever be able too. Its weird because I feel really dramatic for letting it control my life like this and I finally thought I was feeling free again and I just really don't know how to get over the feeling that my worst fear happened again, 11 months later. My heart hurts so bad for everyone involved. Wouldn't wish a situation like this on anyone. Why do I feel like I was there when I wasnt, I feel like ive witnessed it all over again. 

When it happened 11 months ago the man looked a bit like my grandad who took his life a few years ago, two days after my 17th birthday. I dont know what to do, I feel like ill never get past this. "
588,3,"I have been fortunate enough to not be witness to or a victim of acute violence. I don't mean to invalidate any sufferers of that acute, traditional trauma, instead the opposite. I hope you'll see how complex trauma can be, and how every person's mind navigates it differently.

I hope by sharing my experience you can learn how powerful that mind is when fed inconcievable information, and how much of a devil OCD is behind the wheel.

For those of you unfamiliar, OCD is a brutal disease. It attacks you with your worst fear every moment it can throughout the day. My therapist who treats OCD has a son with schizophrenia, and in his professional opinion as a clinician and father, he thinks OCD is worse.

Unfortunatley and unknowingly i fed OCD through college, allowing it to grow. I morbidly read accounts of disease, absorbing other people's trauma into my vivid imagination.

Disease became my obsession, and two seperate nights it became too much.

I was convinced I had cancer even though I was only 22. In full on panic I rushed to the ER. The doctors offered me some time of scan, and I put my trust in them as professionals. Scans done and no biggie, I was okay, phew. 

Yet when reviewing my records I noticed something. A radiation dose report. I looked into it, and everything fell apart. I had two juicy CT scans, a tool reserved for those who really really need it, because of the risk or radiation (particularly in young people) causing cancer down the line. 

Is it guaranteed? No. Is it a theorized low risk? Yes. But it's like cigarretes, you can indulge, but better hope you get lucky. 

And so OCD was FULL of ammunition and my whole life changed, present, past, future.

Presently I was in despair, breaking down and withdrawing from my loved ones. I watched my parents cry and tear each other apart in confusion because their son turned suicidal, convinced he ironically doomed his own future in acts of self-preservation

Looking to that future, all I saw was my body turning on me at some indeterminate time when I'm happily living with my guard down. I see myself wilting away in a deathbed. 

And in the past? Enormous despair. The memories of those quick scans became horror movies, where I'm strapped to a table with all my visualized organs being scrambled by radiation. I truly hate myself and every past choice that led me to the ER, even going to college and successfully graduating.

Maybe you think this is a massive overreaction, and to that I would say probably, but you don't understand OCD. 

It's unfortunatley very real to me. My body, my life, and my mind is shutting down in preparation for getting cancer. My body is no longer safe, but a ticking time bomb. I don't scratch my ""belly"", i rub my large intestine or my pancreas or my liver, hoping their cells stay healty. 

My dreams are gone, and it's all because I fed my mind horrible stories from the internet, and panicked in the middle of the night. Even if I make it out of this pit, my formative young adult years will have been spent navigating fear and self-hatred as a shell of a person.

Thanks for reading and take care of yourself.

589,0,"Hello! I had my first few EMDR sessions recently, including today, and while I was skeptical at first; it does seem to help lighten the load a bit. I am dead tired after each session though! I was wondering if there are other people here diagnosed with PTSD that are receiving EMDR therapy sessions and how they're experiencing it (so far)."
590,2,"As you can see with the title I have trauma with the dark and I don't know what to do about it. It started when I was at a ripe young age of 6-7 and when your young most kids don't like being in the dark. But it was egged on by a older brother I have that I will call Ryan (not real name) Ryan is the oldest brother in the family and he was in his angst teen phase and he would take out his anger on other people around him. He was going through some stuff of his own that I will not name. But I feel like that isn't an excuse to take his anger out on his younger siblings. When I was at this age he would yell at me constantly/ignore me or just be angry at me for no reason. When I was in my room doing my own stuff probably playing with toys or doing stuff that a 6 year old would do he came bursting in and started yelling at me to go to sleep and close my door and to turn off my lights because it would supposedly interfere with his video games. And the thing was I was all the way down the hall where you could barely see a light/ hear anything. 

He kept yelling at me and I was basically terrified at this point because I was only a six year old who couldn't defend herself from a 16-17 year old boy. And then all together he turned off my lights and shut the door and left me in the dark crying. I ran and turned on my lights and opened the door. He came charging at me because he noticed I had opened my door. And it was just basically a cycle of him yelling, me crying, him turning off lights and closing door sometimes even holding the door shut to leave me trapped in my room alone. And this would constantly happen every time he played video games at night. This has left me traumatized even when older and I always need a night light in my room or the door wide open and light outside my room. And I got my own room recently and now I'm all alone. And now I sometimes relive the moment of what happened a long time ago. He still lives in our home and I try to have a good relationship with him but he has also done other traumatizing things to me and makes me uncomfortable. To the point where I have nightmares about him.

I am part of a religion where people go on missions to places to talk about our religion. Why I'm mentioning this is because he went on one a few years ago and he now says he's a ""changed man"" but he still has habits of being mean to others and being the rudest person I know. So he still lives with me and the rest of the family, and he makes me really uncomfortable a lot, and I have voiced this to my parents and they have tried talking to him but it just doesn't work. All I'm asking is what do I do? How can I process all of what has happened to me? How can I get passed this?"
591,1,"My last therapist diagnosed me with ptsd six months ago, I can't do school or work which I know is normal. I couldn't find one since then so it's been a self workout as every therapist I call doesn't answer

Issue is, it's mostly caused by my parents fighting for most of my childhood (4-14 every two days to every day) with yelling, threatening eachother or their own livelihood, quiet hushed discussions of blaming eachother over everything or putting me into the fight as leverage. I just don't feel like it's abnormal for parents to fight like that, it's all I've ever known. The tension in the room after, having to somehow cheer up either or both of them was completely normal to me. Or getting yelled at myself because the tension was very high

But now, that im 18 and my father moved out four years ago, it still feels just like then when the dishes clatter, when there is some tense wording of sorts or else. It's like no place is safe anymore.

I know it's not normal, but I feel like my reason for this should be worse. I kinda wished I had a therapist, but I can't find one at all, and a clinic is out of the picture because the one in my city is horrid "
592,1,"When I was younger, I was a very feminine boy. Because of that, a group of boys at school constantly bullied and harassed me. At first it was limited to school, but over time the abuse spilled into my life outside school. I never told anyone — I was too ashamed and afraid no one would believe me.

One day, an older guy stepped in and stopped them. At first, I thought he was helping me. He was kind to me, gave me gifts, and I believed he accepted me for who I was. I mistook his attention for care, because no one else had ever made me feel seen.

But slowly, I realized he had his own intentions. He started demanding that I dress and act like a girl. It wasn’t a request — it was a condition. If I didn’t obey, he would threaten me with the idea that those boys would come back, or worse. Eventually, he began using shame, fear, and blackmail to control me.

He knew my vulnerabilities. He used the photos, the secrets, and my silence against me. Over the years, I was manipulated into doing whatever he wanted — physically, sexually, emotionally. It wasn’t just abuse. It was domination.

To this day, I’m still trying to process what happened to me. I often feel dirty, worthless, and lost. But I’m tired of being silent. Writing this is a way for me to take back a piece of myself."
593,2,"Hi. I’m 23, and almost a year ago I lost my dad unexpectedly. He was only 45. A week before he died, he had a heart attack, but after his surgery the doctors seemed optimistic and told us he’d be okay. So we believed them. Then I found him passed away in his home when he didn’t show up for work. I still can’t get that image out of my head. I still remember scream-crying on the phone with the police.

I have three young boys of my own, and I feel like something inside me broke after that. Just a few weeks ago, I also found my cat, who we loved so much, had died in a horrible way. I thought she was just sleeping.

Ever since then, I’ve been in a really dark place. Every time I see someone sleeping, I panic. I don’t see peace, I see death. I keep checking on my kids constantly, terrified they’re not breathing. I’ve panicked and cried because I genuinely thought they were gone. It’s like my brain is always preparing for the worst, and I can’t turn it off.

I have panic attacks almost every day. I cry in secret because I don’t want my kids to see me like this. Sometimes it even feels like I might be the one having a heart attack. I’m constantly on edge. I feel like I’m living in a nightmare that never ends.

I just need someone to hear me and to understand. I’m at my breaking point. "
594,1,"I normally wouldn't post on here but my husband working where I have basically no contact, and he's who I'd have these conversations with, I need to rant. 

I was not SA'd as a minor, it happened to me as an adult. By my ex-boyfriend. I had friends who would hang around him only because he was my bf, but they didn't think he was abusive in any way. Nobody suspected it, I didn't even realize it was SA until I opened up to my parents about it, I thought it was my fault too. I get flashbacks from occasionally and it's hard to get out of those depressive moments, especially when I can't talk to anybody about it. What's hard is I don't feel like I can get any justice from it. Anything legal I can find is about minors, so it doesn't apply to my situation. And I had a friend I confided in, but she didn't say much and I found out later apparently misheard me so that didn't turn out well. I just feel like there's not enough support, and my situation isn't seen as bad as minor situations. 
Does anyone have an experience similar? "
595,2,"After multiple tests over 2-3 years, I've come to realize that my IBS symptoms are most likely tied to PTSD and/or chronic abnormal anxiety that I've had since middle school (I didn't learn about gut-brain axis until more recently), and it's been an uphill struggle to deal with ever since. Before some extremely stressful life events that kicked off, these symptoms were non-existent in my life. 

The symptoms often manifest as general tenseness and bowel agitation, mainly in the form of LLQ (left-lower quadrant) burning, bloating, and abnormal gurgling and discomfort, in addition to possible abnormal pelvic tightness that likely stems from involuntary body armoring. They also involuntarily kick in when people are physically close to me, or I'm packed in close to other people, even when they're not doing anything actively threatening to me, but magically die down when I have alcohol in my system, or go to a quiet place without people. 

I'm going to try prozac soon to see if it makes a difference, and wanted to ask if any of you deal with this, and if so, how do you manage? "
596,2,"Hi all, I (20F) have been in regular therapy for the past 3 years working through various instances of sexual abuse from childhood. I was diagnosed with PTSD at 18 and have been taking antidepressants for about 2 years now. I feel like I put so much effort into my healing and I honestly don’t know if I am helping myself or just further traumatising myself by digging all of this up. I don’t know if healing is possible for me, I really struggle to accept and forgive even though I know it is what I need to do. Has anyone got any piece of advice on what I should do or what has been helpful for you in your healing journey, EMDR is an option I have not tried but hoping to start in the near future! Thank you :)"
597,1,"I’m new here I have ptsd from being hurt by my family it bad ways and I just joined because I wanted to talk about it a little bit
"
598,2,"Ok so I was in a abusive relationship for 3 years, he was mentally, emotionally and physically abusive to me and controlled my every move. I wasn't allowed to hang out with my only friend and when I did he would blow up my phone and SH. There's alot more to this but honestly dont really have the energy to explain it all. Well I've noticed certain smells cause me to feel kinda weird and then I start having a flashback of something he did or said to me but the smells dont make sense, like I dont remember smelling it when it happened. Am I losing my mind? Also I am no where near him, he's in Maine and I moved to Alabama 2yrs ago after he left me. "
599,3,"Hello,

I have been in survival mode most of my 42 years: some sexual abuse at the hands of a teacher when I was 12 and during my 23 year relationship with my abusive narcissistic ex. He coercively controlled my entire life and abused me in every non physical way. I left with my life and kids 3 years ago and filed for divorce. The divorce has been horrific and an extension of the abuse. I have C-PTSD and ADHD since childhood and have been (and still am) in treatment. 

I share custody and am not currently working (I start another graduate program in the fall) - so I have had time to rest, do therapy and see my psychiatrist. I take my meds, I read the books. I love to exercise, paint and see friends. I was a high achieving engineer before becoming a mom almost 10 years ago and I volunteer extensively in my community - I’m not lazy by nature. 

My divorce is finally coming to a close and while that’s a huge relief, it’s also super scary and overwhelming. Lately, the days stretch on and I can’t motivate myself to do anything. I have to force myself and after I do, I’m unreasonably exhausted. I used to be such a go getter, I had goals and aspirations, but over the past month I’ve found myself just wanting to sleep all the time. I understand I am healing, I know I should give myself grace - but I’m ashamed of how little I accomplish now in a day which only pushes me back. How long does this phase of healing last after being under chronic abuse? I’m afraid I’ll be this way forever. 

I know everyone’s stories and experiences are different, so I’d love to hear yours. 

Much love and healing to you all


"
600,2,"A summery if my background. I have ADHD. Been in therapy off and on for years. Havnt been able to sleep more than a few hours straight since I was 13, tell today. My parents fought, was raised to be a quiet obedient Christian girl (no way in hell) 
Dad was a gaslighting narcissist. And I have no memories under the age of about 12. 
Ive grown as a person so much, I'm in a much better place now. Therapy and mental health are very important to me. I'm so much more self aware now.
But despite therapy I feel underlying trauma I've never addressed.
For a time I thought I couldn't have ptsd. As if you only ""qualified"" for it by having a VERY VERY extreme trauma. Turns out that's not true. And it's how traumatic it is to the individual on how THEY perceive what happened.
So I ignored it. Threw myself into emotional growth and awareness. While it has been great. Therapy only got me so far.
But the trauma is still very present in my daily life. I'm constantly nervous and anxious. I have to be such a kiss ass people pleaser to keep a calm energy everywhere I go. Even I cringe that I do it. I feel fake, and I can feel from others they don't like it. Or that they feel they can do and say whatever they want around me. Cuz I know I'm afraid to stand up for myself.
I never sleep unless it's from complete exhaustion, and I still wake up EVERY night and it can take hours to get just a little more sleep.
If there is a physical conflict around me I feel my body tense up and I feel the fear. My nervous energy to calm the situation down also makes me uncomfortable but I do it anyway, cuz of that feeling that I'm not ok. I'll be driving, walking, or just anything basic. And I soon as I hear something fall on the floor. A noise that was loud, even a dog park! I flinch! I jolt! I can't help but jump! Even when I know it's not a threat it's instinctive.
My adhd medication has helped calm down my rasing thoughts some. But ive never been able to kick these others things. I do them without fail or thinking EVERY DAY. 
I shouldn't have put it off this long. But im tired of living in this state of fear. I'm still scared that ptsd treatments/therapy will have no effect. And I know there is no escaping bad things happening in life. But ive never faced this fear head on. 
I want to grow. I feel this chaining me back. Im taking singing lessons and soon college classes. And I feel that fear and doubt keeping me small. I know I'm smart enough. But my brain and body don't listen to me. Even when I know my past is not my fault. I have a doctor appointment soon to start some treatments for ptsd. Gotta admit I'm afraid. But I dont want to be anymore "
601,2,"when i take some SSRIs they change my memories. i have traumatic memories that are extremely scary and disgusting, but for example fluvoxamine which I am taking now shifts attention away from this event. my childhood memories that are not the time period of my trauma now seem disgusting and frightening, although there is no reason for this. I don't know if this is a ptsd thing or not, but has anyone encountered this?"
602,1,"Me at the time (8 F) was left with my father (35 m) while getting was sick, my father had been to the er 4 times before the incident being sent home ever time with simple antibiotics, my mother (34 f) left to a camp with my sister (9 f) and brother (14 m) that my father was supposed to take them to on Friday, first 3 days I was the only person with my father, he had a bad infection that required me to change his sheets daily, I had to take care of him completely myself including calling my grandma to take me out to get food as this was 2020 and so we didn't have much food in the house, on monday my mom and siblings got back, my mom immediately sent us kids to her and my fathers room (my dad was in my brothers room as it was closest to the bathrooms) because my father was literally decaying alive and I hadn't realized because I was a child, I remember looking out the window as they loaded my father into a ambulance, he was taken to the hospital and flew to Amarillo Texas (we lived in Oklahoma at the time), I didn't see either of my parents for a long time, as I said it was 2020 so my school was virtual, I spent the time sharing a room with my sister at our grandmas house, I started to become depressed, I didn't see my mom for another 3 months when my father was brought back and put in a physical therapy place where we could only see him through a window, I didn't get to hug him for another 2 months after that, they had said that when they got him on Tuesday in the hospital in the beginning that if he didn't have surgery by Friday he would be dead. I have always felt like that was my fault and have had major depression episodes because of it, everyone has always said to me to just ignore people so I have gotten good at just turning off my emotions, I did that for almost a year just numb and floating by acting happy even when I got maybe a hour of sleep per night and everything was to loud or to quite, I blamed myself for not noticing it getting enough help for him as he still has a lot of health issues because of this. That brings me to the current situation I'm now 13 and was in the car with my mom and sister, my sister was talking about her trauma just like joking about it (she had a lot of stuff happen in 2023) and I said a small joke that I had trauma, my mom got mad at this and said I don't have any trauma, this happened about a month ago but I still think about it constantly, she has always favored my sisters feelings and said im basically emotionless but thats because when I showed emotion I was told not to, so I don't, I have always been quite but was a violent child always misbehaving so she got the image that if I showed emotion it was bad, I still feel numb most of the time and I still always feel bad when I see my father in pain, my mother shutting me down again I guess just made me snap. Last year I didn't go to school because a kid said I stabbed him with a pencil and filed a restraining order, I fell extremely depressed as my mother made me go virtual, then after Christmas break I got to go back as the last court date happened,but I was still depressed heavily, my sister got emotional and complained about fake friends even though I told her they were fake and she didn't listen, so we went virtual again, leaving me to stay depressed and stressed. So the thing with my mother and the stress of last year I have really bad anxiety, I'm depressed, and I feel numb most of the time, I'm just good at hiding it."
603,2,"I feel like everyone in my life is gonna think I'm crazy or treat me differently. I'm so scared.
I'm going to therapy to learn ways to cope and manage it. I was raped as a teen also grew up in an emotionally abusive religious household, amongst other things. When there's no consistency or stability in my life, especially in relationships, I get triggered or always feel like I'm doing something wrong or will ruin things. I always feel like I'm unlovable or difficult. I started having more anxiety and panic attacks recently and sometimes nothing relieves them other than waiting til I tire out enough to fall asleep. Medication is something I want to be a last resort because I'm afraid of the side effects. "
604,2,"My father was attack at a hospital by security guards but when we went to visit him he was speaking gebberish like there are people trying to kill him but we thought he was just saying things and we went to pick him up today at the hospital and he is saying there are soldiers trying to kill him and he needs to hide and the car is not safe I dont know what to do he was in the military
"
605,0,"Looking for good audiobooks for sleep. Not sure where to look. Perhaps books that are narrated in a calming or soothing voice. I mean could be real simple sweet stuff, like children's books but it could also cover more adult stories and literature, science, medicine, culture, biography, religion/spirituality, whatever, as long as focus is on things that are not too violent or triggering."
606,1,"When I was at the age when kids do stupid things I babysat for a family we were friends with up the street.  The next day their mom talked to my mom. I didn't hear what they talked about but my mom made it clear to me afterwards that what I did was not acceptable.  I don't remember exactly what happened but I'm pretty sure it was of the ""playing doctor"" variety.  Initial guilt and shame has evolved into self loathing, years of substance abuse, and depression.  The thought that I hurt her in way that he carries a burden in her heart... it makes me ill but I accept that as my own punishment. I am so sorry if I hurt her.

Its been 45 years since that happened and she reached out recently to offer condolences on my mom's passing. I don't want forgiveness; I don't deserve it. I deserve the pain and guilt and will carry it to my grave.  I just want to make sure she's ok.

And to say ""I'm sorry.""

Should I?"
607,0,"After ~18 weeks of Cognitive Processing Therapy, I had my last session today! It ended with me writing an impact statement about why I now believe my traumatic event happened, in contrast to the impact statement I wrote at the beginning of my treatment.

I did CPT as a full-time college student and it took so much effort and dedication. There were many days where I really didn’t want to go to therapy, and many days where I walked home in tears. But, I am so glad to have done it and I am eternally grateful to my therapist. I can really say that I have worked through to many of my issues and I am well prepared for the future, when triggering things come up. The amount of growth I have had in these past 18 weeks has been monumental. 

To anyone who is contemplating CPT, I say do it. It took me nearly 4 years after my traumatic event to find help, but that’s okay, we are all on our timeline. And to anyone still completing CPT, good luck to you. :) "
608,2,"ello & thank you for any advice you may have! I recently applied for a job & was hired. I did disclose that I have ptsd on the form (I’m just now discovering that that’s not necessary). Now they have asked for letters from my doctor about how the ptsd is managed. I was diagnosed 9 years ago, I was on medication at first but am now successfully managing without & have been for years. Potential job emailed me saying that they need documentation about my condition or my offer is getting revoked. #1 I did not ask for any accommodations, which I understand to be the only time they can ask for that. #2 I do not have a healthcare provider. I am healthy & do not regularly go to any doctor, unless it’s for antibiotics. I have no insurance to begin going to a doctor,nor would any “sign off” that I’m mentally healthy with a single visit. I would not be able to even get into a doctor before the deadline is up. I let them know that I am not seeking any accommodations. What else can I do?"
609,1,"(warning) I’m a female and when I was younger my step sister had put her hands on my for the first time when I was 7 it went on for about a year or two im not really sure, she was very aggressive when she did this things and forced me to do a whole lot of things witch her and her sister my other step sister they would just joke and laugh saying I wanted it and if I didn’t I would say so but I felt trapped and embarrassed about the whole thing. I haven’t told anyone about it except my ex boyfriend who took advantage of that trauma and two of my friends who I have known since I was younger the two of them don’t bring it up and know certain things trigger me like touch, they let me ask if I wanted a hug or ask if they can touch me (not s3xually) like put a hand on my thigh for comfort or on my shoulder or hug me. They are very sweet and have tried to help me move on from the trauma of it, I just don’t know how to fully move on especially because of my ex who took advantage of me ( he only used his hands but I never told him I wanted it and I did tell him to stop but I was in a place where I couldn’t  move away from him) so how do I move on or at least get over it?

Sorry if some of the writing isn’t right im not good with English so I try my best."
610,3,"Like especially if you were in a bigger city and then also moved really far away from someone that is consistently awful to you, how often have you run into them? I feel like I’ve lost my life trying to avoid someone I can’t get away from for years. 

I have a friend who has lived in a big city her whole life and her ex lives there too but she never sees him. 

Even if you run into someone every now and then sure it’s not a big deal, but it seems relentless. Plus, I feel like people that run into each other a lot, especially for years, would eventually try to clear things up, but there’s never any explanation with this person. It’s just been bullying for years and I’ve even gone homeless from how expensive it has been trying to get away from the person, and then also tried to commit suicide just to get it to stop because it’s seriously affecting my life and he has no remorse. "
611,2,I’ve been diagnosed with ptsd depression. My father has alcoholism and my mother has depression. You’re telling me I can experience those same traits? I’m not talking about how the dysfunction affected my childhood. I mean referring to the “phenomena” of simply experiencing the same conditions because they simply pass down to the next generation like a gene? That doesn’t sound real to me. Can someone please help me explain how mental trauma can be hereditary??? That can’t be true. 
612,1,"I have a history of sexual trauma, and last night when I used a toy in bed for the first time, I felt a lot of those same feelings. I've felt nauseous, disgusting and hollow all day today, and last night I had to shower multiple times to feel even slightly less gross. I couldn't sleep in my bed last night and couldn't stop crying as soon as I was finished. Why did this happen? It was supposed to be nice☹️ This hurts so bad, even seeing a sex joke online kills me today."
613,3,"A few weeks ago I finished my CPT treatment, which involves a lot of processing and the therapist helping you challenge your “stuck points” (I.e., if your stuck point is “I can’t trust anyone” the therapist explores why you believe that and how to disprove that so you can change your thought process). You go in depth with a lot of your trauma and it’s difficult. I was able to ask her for a lighter session if needed, but overall my symptoms have gone up. After the first 2 or 3 appointments I was experiencing more nightmares, flashbacks, and panic attacks, and longer dissociative episodes. As I progressed it may have gone down slightly, not not to where I was before. To put it into perspective, my PCL-5 score was 60 or 62 on intake, during treatment my highest score was 74 and lowest after intake score was 70.

I feel like CPT was helpful in the sense that I understand how my stuck points were there to help me survive, but now that I’m safe they aren’t needed anymore. I understand logically my stuck points aren’t true anymore, but something subconsciously got worse. It got so bad I was sent to PHP. I almost feel cheated out of getting better because I was told this would help and I’d only feel worse for a little bit and that if I just completed this cycle of treatment I’d feel better, but I feel worse. There’s too many open boxes.

Is there anyone who can relate to this after CPT? Did it get better over time and actually help or was it completely non-helpful for you?"

Not all touch is skin.  
Not all theft leaves scars.  
Sometimes, what’s taken  
is unseen—  
a sigh, a gaze, a silence too long held.

You feel it before you know it:  
the weight of another’s grief  
settling on your shoulders  
like it was always yours.

Anger, too, wears borrowed shoes—  
a fury rising in your chest  
that didn’t begin with you.  
Someone else let it go,  
and it found you open.

Despair is a fog that drifts.  
It needs no invitation.  
It clings to the warm,  
the gentle,  
the ones still willing to feel.

Even joy  
can jump like lightning,  
lighting up faces that forgot  
they could glow.

Ambition sparks across rooms,  
a wildfire of urgency,  
while shame seeps slow—  
in glances, in tones,  
in the places where love is withheld.

We are not islands.  
We are bridges,  
rivers,  
chambers of echo.

What moves between us  
can build or burn,  
can heal or harm,  
can pass like breath

So learn the shape of your own energy—  
name its heat, its pace, its hum.  
And when the wind of someone else

615,2,"i dont wanna burden my friends with this but its 5 am and i just want either answers or advice. i have extreme short term memory loss from being gaslit from 9-17 (maybe even 7-17 but i dont know). i have just general memory loss from my childhood as well. when i was 10-11, i was annoying my mom and we walked into the playroom closet (big enough to fit 4 people). i was talking to her when all of the sudden she reached her hands out and wrapped her hands around the base of my neck, no pressure was really applied but it was firm. it was only for a second and she walked out immediately after. i remember feeling betrayed and hurt, and followed her a few moments later. i asked “did you just choke me?” or something along those lines and she said something like “what? no.”. i remember it so vividly but i feel like it was just one of my weirdly realistic dreams. i feel like my mom would never hurt me like that but recently she threw a suitcase at my sister (she missed) and it makes me kind of wonder if it actually happened. does anyone else have weirdly vivid dreams and mistake them as reality too? what therapy could help me figure out if this was a dream or a reality? i appreciate any help that can be given"
616,2,I've already been diagnosed with cptsd for the trauma I've suffered over years but today I almost lost my life. I was driving home and my car managed to sheer the lug nuts off of the right side passenger wheel. When it first happened I thought it was a transmission issue because I couldn't brake and the rpm meter was going crazy. I was going down a hill where the speed limit was 55 and my car started freaking out with the inability to brake and for a while it started swerving back and forth. I managed to get control back and slowed down while turning on my emergency lights. I pulled over to the shoulder to check out what happened and I didnt notice anything. I started my car back up and the rpm seemed normal as well as the warning disappeared I managed to slowly take it back to the town I live in managing about 5 miles with the wheel precariously attached not knowing what had happened. I got back to my town and pulled into a store by the entrance to the town and the wheel fell off when I made the turn into the parking lot. I managed to keep control and park away from other cars but there was an awful screeching from the grinding of the hub against the asphalt. I managed to collect the wheel get a ride home and eventually get my car towed. All that I've been able to think about since is that I could've been sent into a cliff face or a guard rail going 55 and lost my life. Having a scare of this proportion is some of the worst mental trouble I've had and I don't know if it will go away. I don't know if this trauma will last or if I'll be good to drive again but after so much trouble with my thoughts and thinking of taking my life in the past (luckily I've gotten over and have been doing a lot better) I just feel so fragile having almost lost myself to something I couldn't control. I feel so out of my body. I found a bit of solace in talking to the owners of a local game store after the incident and they were shocked and I bought a few cards for a game i play to try and shock myself back into reality for a bit. I've had probably 300mg of caffeine and a nap since but now that it's sunk in at 3am the next morning I cant escape the thoughts and haven't been able to get any more sleep. I might call out tommorow and try and rest I'll definitely contact my therapist but im just grateful im alive.

CN physical abuse, sexual abuse

Hello everyone. I (24 afab) am trying to make sense of something that really shook me and made me question who I am.
A few months ago something happened with my partner. Our relationship was going through a rough patch at the time, and I had been feeling a lot of emotional instability and loss of control.
That night we were drinking and I was very drunk. I apparently choked her hard during intimacy — something we did not agree on. I sometimes gently place my hand on her neck, but real choking is a clear boundary for me because of my own sexual trauma (I was raped several times at 17-18 and choking was part of it). So while she would have been open to it, I said I didn’t want to do it.
She told me later I got up straight after choking her and just went back to cook food while she was left alone and crying on the couch. 
I remember cooking and her teasing me — then nothing, until I suddenly saw her crying. And I didn’t understand why. I had no clue what had just happened. It felt like being dropped into a scene from someone else’s life.
When I realized what I had done, I broke down crying. But I also hated myself for that — because I knew she was the one who was hurt, and I should have been there for her, not collapsing emotionally myself.
I’m in therapy since a few months and am trying to work through it. She said that it sounds like i was dissociating due to my trauma and this might have triggered me becoming abusive myself. I’ve cut back on drinking and my partner and i mostly stopped BDSM or physical power dynamics. But I’m still terrified. I am normally not an aggressive person and i never did something like that before.
My partner didn’t want to make a huge deal out of it, but now, a few months later she feels it does affect her and she starts reflecting more deeply. She told me she now doesn’t feel safe bringing up issues with me — afraid of how I might react again if things in the relationship feel unstable. I can totally understand that.
She’s asked for space now, and I respect that. I don’t know how I can guarantee that it never happens again.
What if I dissociated? What if I lose control again and hurt someone without remembering? It makes me question everything I thought I knew about myself.:( 

Has anyone experienced something similar? Did you find ways to deal with it? How can i and my partner rebuild trust in myself? Thank you"
618,2,"3 weeks ago I found a hard drive with a bunch of stuff from my previous job. When I was browsing the files I discovered a backup with some important documents. I found 2 documents that keep my attention: the salary for each employee and the stock offers.

For my surprise I discovered 2 things as well: my salary was not so good as I expected. Even there was newer employees with less responsibilities receiving a greater amount of money. But my other surprise was that many people received stock options. Some colleges received 70k, 120k, 160k USD when the company was sold to a bigger one, meanwhile I remember that one of the founders came to my home and gave me 2.000 USD and one of the bills was fake.

I panicked, like falling inside a limbo. I realized that my colleges didn't told me much about it, and they were in the right to not do so, but I felt betrayed. Even I felt betrayed by my ex-boss when I asked him about the possibility of some stock options in the early days (I worked there for 7 years) and he said there was none.

After that, I had 3 weeks of flashbacks imagining my ex colleges launching at me, waking up at 3 am and not be able to sleep until 8 am, having pain at my chest, high blood pressure, and blurry vision. I checked with a doctor and gave me medication for my high blood pressure and ecitalopram 10g (I used it for a long time).

I can sleep much better now, but I still have these flashbacks. I also have intrusive thoughts about sharing all this information by email to my former colleges that didn't receive any stock like me, or calling my ex-boss and asking him ""Why not me?"". I am not planning to do it either. This whole situation really triggered my rejection sensitive dysphoria.

How do you cope with this kind of situations? I feel like the pass is dragging me and I don't like it a bit."
619,1,"(I need advice for my vent. So I was unsure which tag to use)

So when I was 12 I was dating a 16 y/o. Everything went wrong, I was cheated on, told I’m acting like a child (guess what) and it harmed me so much. The worst thing about this is that I have a terrible relationship with my parents and grandmother so I don’t even habe someone to look up to. Anyways 

Everytime when I’m in a relationship I break up with them bc I met someone new. It’s seriously concerning how I just stop loving someone by the second I lay my eyes on someone else. I don’t cheat tho! I first break up and then make my moves but it’s torture. 

I just want to love without getting flashbacks or manipulated. The guy I’m dating right now is gaslighting me every day but I still love him so much. Even though I met this guy at a party, we are friends and I had so much fun with him.. 
what the f is wrong with me? "
620,2,"In this case, I’m referring to a newish potential partner who has no experience with (complex) trauma.

I have a few concerns around:
- oversharing details
- causing them to leave when they see I’m “damaged goods”
- waiting too long to say anything

I think i have to proceed with caution to avoid saying too much and also not waiting so long that they feel like I’ve been keeping a big secret from them.

I am NOT looking for comments/advice like, “if they leave, then it wasn’t meant to be”. That’s not helpful for me because i would continue to face the same challenge.

When is the right time to disclose your history of complex trauma, and how do you do it without scaring the person off?

I don’t have much relationship experience and I haven’t even shared this much with friends because of issues around trust & intimacy.

Thanks in advance."
621,0,"What methods do you use?  I'm looking for ideas to steal.  I'll try anything, no matter how peculiar, I just need to sleep!"
622,2,"I’m agoraphobic and emetophobic (and a C-PTSD sufferer due to the abuse from my parents), so I’ve struggled greatly with leaving the house and eating but since the beginning of this year it’s in overdrive and making me scared of anything and everything. Too scared to leave the house, too scared to eat (I just nibble snacks during the day and try not to panic because every time I eat my anxiety is convinced I’ll be sick because of said anxiety though I’ve not been sick since I was a very small child), too scared to leave my room to go to the bathroom, scared of night, day, changes in weather, absolutely everything. Even things in TV shows I watch can be triggering when they weren’t triggering before this point. I can’t work because my mental health is very poor, I’m always holed up at home constantly anxious from the moment I wake up to the moment I sleep. Even when there’s nothing technically to be anxious about.

Though, the current thing I’ve been dreading is my dad’s new partner visiting for a week (didn’t know she existed until a few days ago at which point dad had been seeing her for 7 months). This visit was arranged without asking me how I even felt about it what with all my social anxiety and it’s happening in two weeks. I tend to starve myself whenever family come for the day (this is my strategy for anything I dread, when I used to be able to leave the house I’d starve myself before that too) and eat after they’ve left, but this is far too much for me to handle, I’m very scared of strangers. Since I learned about this visit two days ago I’ve completely broken down. I’m barely able to eat or sleep, I’m anxious and terrified all the time and there’s no telling what will set me off into full blown panic. 

I’m so beyond terrified of everything I literally can’t do anything but sit in my room and stew. I feel like a tiny little kid scared of everything all the time and I don’t even know why. I feel so alone in this and full of dread about the partner’s visit so any help would be very appreciated."
623,2,"I am 17, earlier this week I was a piece of a freak incident where a cat I didn't see got scared of me and ran into the road. Where a speeding truck was. I'm not looking for people speculating on the situation. But I have been riddled by guilt as I played a part in it even if unwillingly.

I don't know if it is PTSD but I figure even if it isn't maybe people in here would have advice for me. I knew the cat, and the family, for I've house sat for them. He was a very sweet cat and the screams of the family coming out to see them, the cats final moments, and part of the road where it happened which I have to walk past every day on my way back from school.

I need something to change because right now it temporarily leaves me when I'm distracted but it kills me when my mind isn't busy with life. 

Its possible talk to my parents about it more but I have my own troubles as far as it goes with my parents. 
And I am afraid of dumping this onto anyone else in my current circle because it's a very sensitive subject.

any pointers ?"

625,0,"hi all,

i've recently been enjoying a new YouTube channel i found that exclusively shares low-stimulation EMDR (bilateral) music.

it's been such a helpful piece of self-care to incorporate regularly into my week.

the channel is by a somatic therapist based in Colorado. i haven't worked with her personally, but her site (accessible through the channel) seems warm and inviting. definitely would consider working with her, though, thankfully i have able support lines these days. 

just wanted to share this resource in this community in case it helps someone. if one person here finds this to be as much of a gem as it is for me, then this post will be worth it.

here's the channel:

626,2,"Hey guys, I’m an international student who is 19 years of age out here in Los Angeles doing bachelor’s of business. Today as of May 22, 2025 I got attacked by a homeless outside of a gas station he punched me into the face and two middle teeth of the lower jaw are broken and there’s a lot of blood coming out of my mouth as I was having retainers and after it broke the wires pierced into my tongue . TBH I got a panic attack after this incident and it it getting traumatic as my family is in Mumbai right now. I have got every possible proof like a picture of him, his first name, the video of him attacking me, my picture of injury (I will be attaching it) and a police report and some eye witness too. Please tell me guys what should I do and I’ll really appreciate some support."
627,2,"So I'll be as short as I can. Back in Jan, I got the flu for the first time ever in my life and took Tamiflu. I had heard of kids having psychological bad reactions to it but didn't think about it.

 I proceeded to have severe panic attacks / insomnia for the next two weeks. I sought help from the ER as my mental state had slipped from severe sleep deprivation but I was not suicidal. I wound up being sent to a behavioral health facility. I was drugged there with anti psychotics, had a seizure and basically left for dead. The workers on the floor were shocked when I got up and was walking around the next day. I was there for 8 days.

I'm seeing a therapist but I feel like I'm in a daze from potential PTSD. I went back to work almost immediately - thank goodness I work from home, I have two boys in preschool. On the outside I look back to myself. Inside though I'm a mess. 

I'm not depressed but I feel like if I really did almost die that I'd be super motivated and grateful to be alive, live everyday like it's my last etc. Instead I muddle through what I have to do and I'm not motivated to workout, eat healthier etc. I guess I'm impatient because I thought by now I'd be over what happened and at least really back to normal. 

Does this sound like PTSD?"
628,2,"I just got into a heated argument with my dad over my paranoia. Six years ago a guy harassed and abused me physically, mentally, and sexually when I was nine until I was eleven and I’m still not over it. Go figure, PTSD. I have extreme paranoia now. Every guy no matter what I immediately start imagining the worst, I look at their hands and pockets to see if they’re armed, worry they have a gun, they’ll hurt me, try to grab me. It’s intense and sudden. Tonight I was suddenly paranoid about my brother, irrationally worrying that he could have a gun since I saw him put something in his pocket. My dad came to talk to me about it, saying how it’s insulting because we’re family and that I can’t expect people to accommodate to me and make me feel safe. I said I understand but it’s not that hard to quickly affirm me that everything is okay because I’m struggling and I can’t control what freaks me out. That I don’t think rationally in those moments. I told him that it’s not my fault if it comes across as insulting since as my family they should know I’m not targeting them because I’m just reacting based on the trauma I went through. He told me it was six years ago and that he’s not going to “play into it”, it being aiding my trauma. This of course made me very uncomfortable, it’s like he didn’t care whatsoever. He said that just how they can’t expect me not to panic that I can’t expect them to accommodate to my trauma. I’d usually agree, but he’s my father. I can’t believe he thinks that the years of trauma I went through and the terrible things it’s caused me are just as hard as him being slightly insulted, in which it wasn’t an insult, it was genuine panic that resulted from trauma. An irrational thing I thought my own father would empathize with but apparently I’m the problem. I feel so alone, there’s nobody to support me right now. All I could do was sob once he stormed out, my eyes are all puffy now. I just need to be told again that it’s not my fault. That it’s not to much to ask to be supported by my family and feel safe while I’m still healing. That I’m not healing too slowly. "

630,2,"Today was my (21F) first pap smear. Most of my trauma is from childhood and unfortunately a few very bad experiences over the last 3 years. I was already slightly nervous about it before today, but I had no clue they'd be doing everything today, I thought it would just be to establish care/get history, but I was too shy and nervous to ask if we could wait till next time for the full exam. I think the cold, detached nature of the exam- no small talk or attempting to get to know me prior to, no questions about my history to really give me a chance to discuss my PTSD, no asking if I was comfortable- made it so much more triggering than even the experiences I've had with partners since my traumas. I was trying not to cry through the whole thing and ended up doing so after the doctor and nurse (thankfully female) left the room. Has anyone else experienced this or had good ways to handle it? She said it would only be yearly, but even thinking of doing this again is giving me anxiety."

I got into an accident when my car slipped on black ice and a light pole fell on my car. The police were amazing everyone was beyond helpful. I was a senior in high school at the time. It’s been 11yrs, I moved to the desert to avoid snow. I pretty much stopped driving all together about 8 yrs ago because my anxiety gets too bad. I can barely sit in a car without having at least one mini panic attack per trip. I had to drive a friend somewhere today(20 min drive time total), I was shaking so bad I cried when I finally got home. My kids deserve to get out more than we do(we take them out regularly, my husband does the driving) and I feel like it’s becoming more of an issue than it was before.

636,0,"Question for those who have undergone professionally guided psychedelic-assisted therapy:

How important do you think it is to share your experience with close others (family or friends) after psychedelic-assisted therapy?

Did you receive emotional support from family or friends? And if so, how meaningful was it for you—or did you feel you didn’t need it at all?

I’m curious to hear whether you believe that this kind of sharing contributes to healing or self-understanding, or if it felt less relevant to your personal process."
637,0,"I have (c)ptsd and have been coping with it for a **very** long time (at least since 2012). I've also managed to become successful in my career in academia. I earned a BA in English (Creative Writing) prior to traumatic life events that caused my diagnosis, and then returned to school to earn a BS in Neuroscience and finally MS/PhD in Computer Science. I am currently a Computer Science professor, and I find an enormous degree of fulfillment in my career---even though managing my ptsd in the background remains an incredible (and mostly invisible to others) challenge. For a long time, I've been trying to figure out, how can I help share my experiences of managing my illness with people who would want to hear from someone like me. My only goal in this would be support, encouragement, and  care for both current students or folks who want to change their careers through education, but who might be a little scared to try that given how hard ptsd can be.

I'm going to post a few comments with options (AMA thread here next Tuesday or Thursday, or a zoom webinar next Tuesday or Thursday), please upvote all options you'd be interested in.

638,0,"GWOT combat vet. Saw lots of bad things. Came home and fought for 10 years in therapy. Nothing really helped. 

In the past two years that’s all changed. Three things made the difference. First is called a Stellate Ganglion Block procedure. It’s an in office procedure that takes about 30 minutes. It helps turn the switch off. Please see the video below from Medal of Honor winner Dakota Meyer. 

https://youtu.be/I5uSLru6HQI?si=VGmjZibWxPfZ-GoC

Second, THC gummies are a lifesaver. I take one at night for sleep, pain, and to quiet my mind. 

Finally, nature is the best medicine. I bought a few acres of land and got chickens and ducks. They’re very easy to take care of. Sitting under trees just listening to the breeze talking to the birds shut down all the racing thoughts. "
639,3,"This is my first time posting in this group. I don’t know if you’re supposed to put a trigger warning but I will just in case TW. 



I’ve had PTSD for many years from both a horrific childhood and severe violence (& many kinds of abuse) from my ex that kept me captive & tried to murder me. I eventually escaped (literally on foot completely naked) but with a broken jaw, ribs, torn muscles/ligaments, injured neck, ect.  I’m still trying to get my injuries sorted out and it’s been years and some things I will always now have permanent chronic pain. I feel so exhausted all the time. SA & violence throughout my life have really done a number on me if I’m being completely honest. I’ve recently been getting work done on my teeth because after breaking my jaw I was barely able to open my mouth for years. I am now going through the process of trying to stretch it open more & getting the teeth fixed that got broken and other dental work. Just going to those appointments are extremely stressful and I try the whole time to avoid flashbacks (as there’s a lot of trauma & SA that happened via jaw). The smallest things are taking everything out of me. 

Anyways, sorry if I’m rambling. I’ll get to the point of why I’m posting this. I can’t seem to stop isolating from people. I go to a trauma therapist but it’s only once a month on phone until she gets her office back that’s under construction. I also see a psychiatrist every two months that prescribes me clonazepam & hydroxyzine, ect. It feels like between appointments I’m too tired to do anything as I have to push myself so much to even do those things. It’s so so incredibly hard to be around people. In the past I’ve been a part of two online support groups. One for ptsd & the other for mental health/addiction. I have had great support from both of them and now I’ve been avoiding going on them as well. I don’t understand why I stopped going on those groups and why I know how kind those people have been to be but every time I try to go on there I freeze. I actually feel really bad and guilty a little about it too, like I ditched? them or something. I just don’t understand why I hide from and push people away … it’s like I just can’t stop and I hate it. I’m struggling in many ways and sometimes feel very broken and fear permanently broken. There’s a lot more to my story and situation but I definitely probably wrote more than enough here. I feel pretty vulnerable writing this all but I feel I have to reach out or do something. I don’t know … just thank you if anyone even read this.  "
640,2,"A year and a half ago, I went through a traumatic incident at work that resulted in being injured and at first when I talked about the incident to a Doctor or someone who isn't my parents/partner/close friend, I'd immediately start sobbing and would struggle to tell what happened.

Fast forward to yesterday, I had to consult with a workers comp attorney where they asked what my injury was and I immediately began choking up and sat quiet for a minute to gather my thoughts and the courage to tell her. I just felt scared and the urge to cry but I didn't. I feel like this mainly happens when someone asks me what happened rather than me telling the story on my own.

How do you get through situations like this? I don't know if ""just doing it"" is the right way to tackle this. To me, it seems like the right thing because I feel like the more times I talk about it, the more times I become desensitized and can talk about it without a negative reaction.

Thanks!"
641,2,"When I was 13(f) I was repeatedly touched and manipulated by a 'friend' 14(m). He actually made me believe that it was normal and that me being uncomfortable was weird. I cant help but think about it everyday and i keep having panic attacks. after the worst of it happened i told someone and they basically told me to just forget it because its not like i was raped, but i can't i feel like im suffocating everyday, it doesnt help that i saw him resently at a cross- college meeting and he sat next to me accting like he never did anything, i left the room and transfered colleges 2 weeks later for that and other reasons.  it seems like wither he doesnt think he did anything or hes forgotten, part of me thinks ill get closure if he knows what he did or if i get to tell him off. ive tried therapy and so far the 2 therapists ive tried havent helped but im on a waitlist for another and maybe they'll be more helpful, but i dont know. i also dont know how to get rid of the fear and guilt that hes dont this to others, i didnt report him at the time because i was so under his spell i didnt know it was wrong and once i realised after an assembly about concent it felt like it was too late to report him to school. i kept trying to not let what happend take over my life so i repressed it but i cant anymore and i dont know what to do, i dont know why im on reddit saying all this but the subreddit came up on my home page so here it is.

642,1,"My mother recently noticed that I got denied from a school from another district during the district transfer because of my attendance. She told me she’s disappointed in me and that she’s sending me back to regular school. Afterwards I cried to myself in my room. I’m still dreading going back to school with that group of people, as they made me have terrible suicidal and homicidal thoughts. My mother also KNOWS I have diagnosed PTSD and what caused it.
I’m just so lost and I don’t know what to do."
643,2,"TW Coercion - I don't know if this has been asked before, I'll delete it if it has but I was wondering how you can talk about something that was traumatic to you but it involves intimacy in therapy. Like I'm struggling because this guy I was dating made an advance on me and I did say no but he continued and I didn't do more to stop him. It wasn't rape because it didn't go there but the things that were traumatic are still graphic and I just don't know what is acceptable to talk about with a therapist. Are there rules or maybe a specific therapist I should go to? What are the boundaries in general for these kind of things?"
644,1,"It's been years since my assault but I still continue to blame myself. I was going through a very hard time with my home life and moving out from my mom's. I was extremely depressed and had no self worth. And then the assault happened and no one around me was supportive, I went through the trauma of going to the hospital and talking to police,  they made me describe every detail (that i could remember which wasn't much). They told me what happened wasn't rape. Then I went through the trouble of a title ix trial at my school and had to see him again just for them to tell me our stories were equally credible so 🤷‍♀️

I still have flashbacks about what happened to me. Seeing it in TV and movies is the worst. I just hate how still after all this time I still blame myself for getting so drunk. I woke up and didn't remember anything that happened. I was recently watching ER and the exact same thing happened to one of the characters. In the show it was portrayed as cheating but after reading through reddit comments everyone was agreeing they were SA'd. It just felt so validating to see something that happened to me and people almost unanimously defending her. I've been so ashamed for years. It's such a hard thing to go through and to be mostly alone because nobody wants to talk about it. I just wish it would get easier. I wish I could stop feeling like it was my fault. I wish I knew how to be nicer to myself and know how to cope with flashbacks. It's so much worse at night. "
645,2,"Posted this in the c-PTSD subreddit and got no responses, so I figured I’d try my luck here. I was sexually assaulted as a child sometime between the age of 5 - 7. This was done by my brother, who was around 12 at the time. I also have suspicions toward consistent, long-term sexual abuse from the age of 3 - 5 due to some flashbacks that included seeing glimpses of movies I watched at specifically those ages and those years being super blocked out, but not sure of the culprit.

My nightmares have always been about my brother, always. Recently though, I had the worst, most vivid nightmare I’ve ever experienced in my life, but it was with my dad. I was half-asleep, so it was one of those nightmares that took place in the present. I was in my bed, dreaming i was in my bed, if that makes sense. I have never ever had any reason to think my father would ever abuse me, especially since he is a CSA victim himself. I love my dad, and my siblings and my mom always made jokes that I’m his favorite child. I’ve only ever had positive memories and thoughts about him.

Has anyone experienced nightmares in which someone you love was abusing you that, to your knowledge, never abused you?"
646,2,"I'm constantly scared of being raped. I'm scared when I walk home. I'm scared when I talk to my friends. I'm scared when I talk to my boyfriend. The fear is constant, severe, and never-ending. I used to think that, since I rarely experience flashbacks, that meant that it wasn't ""that bad"". I'm not a stereotypical example of PTSD, so obviously mine is mild, right?

No, it's pretty bad. I remember a friend of mine told me that he had a crush on me and over and over again I had the thought of him raping me. I fucking hated it. I wanted it to stop, but it wouldn't. Whenever I'm out walking and a car drives too slow or a person is walking near me, I'm scared they're going to rape me. So, yeah, just wanted to say that I've recently realized that my PTSD IS severe, even if it's not a stereotypical version with flashbacks. I hope I made someone feel less alone"
647,2,"Hello, hope you’re all well. I just have a question that I was wondering if anybody here would be able to help me out with.

I think that I have been in some sort of fight/flight/freeze response since being in a terrorist attack eight years ago and I have seen a lot online about nervous system regulation and how this has really helped people stuck in these states to feel present and relaxed again.

There’s so much information out there though and lots of paid-for courses. I’m happy to pay some money as long as it isn’t too much and I know that will be worth it. 

Does anybody who is also looking into this/feels as though they have achieved this have any advice/can locate some good resources to get started out?

Any help would be appreciated, thanks so much. "
648,3,I (18M) and my family have been going through a hard time in our lives my older brother (25M) it started in August 2024 and got worse and worse as time went on. He tried to kill himself twice luckily me and my mom were there for the first time to stop him and I was there for the second time. But it has progressed so much more that now I am afraid of him. Last week on May 12th my older brother tried to kill my mom and was close to doing it but I managed to get in and stop it and he was taken to the hospital and we know for sure he has some type of schizophrenia.

I was told that it's not good to do that and I need to stop fighting the emotions and let loose on everything that happened as my index trauma unfolds. I don't fully understand what that means. I don't intentionally block my emotions nor do I intentionally lose all thought or memories regarding my trauma. 
Little background: I was in the military from 2013 to 2016 and was sexually assaulted by my ex and his four friends throughout my military career. My performance went downhill, I was getting screamed at a lot by supervisors for it. It got to a point that they failed my barracks room inspection all because it was dusty. Forced me to clean and was told that I didn't clean at all when my supervisors all watched me do it. Was called a liar all because of that. Word gets around fast and whenever I tried saying anything about the sexual assaults I was completely dismissed and told to stop lying. What else could I do? I tried saying it more that I needed help, and I was met with more or less a middle finger to my face each time. So I bottled it all up. If I put up a happy facade then no one will know I'm falling apart on the inside. I forced myself to be small, invisible enough to not be noticed but present enough to be noticed. I fought back each time I was assaulted andeafter each time I would lose myself more. I gained weight just so I can have less time with them. I was 19 at the time it all started. When I finally had enough was when I stabbed a tooth pick in one of his friends eyes... I was 20. I failed my final weigh in after that and was processing out of the military. When I finally got out, I buried everything more. That was how I survived. It's been 9 years since then and I was formally diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety and depression. Now going through therapy is more or less opening up a can of worms. Memory wise when it comes to my index trauma there are pieces missing. I don't fully remember the first sexual assault. I remember most of it but the actual portion I don't fully remember is the assault in the bedroom. I remember fighting back. I remember hitting, biting and trying to twist away. Screaming and crying. But I don't remember the sensations. I don't remember if I froze up and let it all happen. I don't remember... My therapist calls it my hotspot because I rush through that portion or skip over details. I've told her I don't remember a whole lot in fact I lose it all at some point and just there is nothing in my head for me to remember or feel. It's like grabbing for sand and it just slipping through my fingers. She said next session is going to focus on just the hotspot... And I'm utterly terrified of going too deep into my head for details. "

For the past few years, I’ve been dealing with insanely intense, vivid, elaborate dreams, that will turn into nightmares about fifty percent of the time. in these dreams, I experience time passing by for months, up to a year a few times. I’ll experience waking up,experiencing the day, sleeping, and starting again, all within the dream. I’ll be thirty two in September. I’ve done the math, and if you add the time I’ve spent in dreams to my actual life, I’m actually in my fourties. These dreams range in all different directions. Happy endings I never got to experience, horrific ‘worst-case-scenario’ nightmares, amplified re-enactments of my trauma, truly horrible traumatic events like something out of a horror movie. From mundane daily life, to insane fantastical epics. I’ve given birth, I’ve watched all of my loved ones die, I’ve done horrible and wonderful things in these dreams. Every time i wake up, im immediately frozen in panic, sometimes for hours. This morning i woke up violently shaking, barely able to speak. I think the worst part is, I still fall victim to the “the more I try to remember about the dream, the more it slips away” problem. I just remember major details, and the emotions I felt, and my body feels every bit as if that amount of time has passed.

Exhausted isn’t even close to an accurate description of what I feel I don’t feel that I’ve truly slept more than three hours at a time in years. I go from avoiding sleep for days at a time until I almost collapse, for scaring the crap out of my fiancé for sleeping twenty hours once. 
So far, I’ve been able to cope with almost all my other symptoms but this. I just want to wake up and not IMMEDIATELY be terrified. I want to sleep like a normal person. I’m just so tired."

Sharing an experience yesterday at a conference. 
I am retired from law enforcement/fire investigations and have stood over too many fatalities. I am also on the board of directors for a state wide fire investigation training association. We are having one of our 4 yearly conferences this week and yesterdays topic was PTSD/Mental Health. I was asked by the presenter if I would be willing to share some of my triggers and things I avoid to put a face with what he was talking about.
He and I have shared experiences and have talked about our PTSD many times, but few outside my family know I have it.

Yesterday I stood in front of about 200 of my peers and related my career from the first death I witnessed (elderly lady died of natural causes at her home) and went through to the fire scene that triggered my PTSD. It was a triple fatal fire with the father and his 2 sons. What triggered me was the fact the kids were the same age as my 2 sons. 
I talked about things I avoid like roads I try not to go down because I worked a fatal fire on it. The times I have had to go down the roads, I couldn’t help but look to where the house was and I always see it the way it was the day/time I arrived on scene, not like it is today.
I ended my part by telling the audience I wasn’t there for sympathy but to put a face with the information and to try to remove the stygma that is in law enforcement and emergency services against seeing a therapist in the hopes that if one investigator sought out a therapist I would feel I had done some good. 
Yes, I was emotional as I related these events and had to stop a couple of times to compose myself. What suprised me was when I finished I actually had people applauding me for sharing my story. Not to mention coming to me later and again today to thank me for sharing my story. A few told me they were already seeing a therapist which is always a good thing.

So, I have again shared my story with several thousand strangers that I hope can relate 
"
654,2,A lot of people mention nervous system responses or overload when they talk about PTSD. I get a mixture of nerve pain or muscle twitches attached what seems to be to thoughts. Does anyone else experience this sort of thing?
655,2,"My 3 year old was inside, I had to crawl through flames to get her out. 
Now I can’t stop looking for fire hazards everywhere, I can’t stop having anxiety attacks. I can’t stop freaking out and I don’t know how to help myself. I do have an appointment tomorrow with my doctor is there anything I should mention? I don’t know what to do. "
656,2,i am about to move out for college but the thought of living in one room again makes me feel like i'm gonna throw up. any advice anyone? (i have meds and therapy)
657,2,"I can’t believe this is real. I just want to wake up and go back to being vulnerable with my parents but I’m too scared to even talk to them right now. 

A few weeks ago I had a blow out argument with my parents where I told them to go to therapy.  They revealed to me that they have actually both been going to therapy for months. 

I stop arguing the point because I figured it wasn’t my place to prod into their mental health journeys further if they purposefully hadn’t shared. 

After that argument my mom had become increasingly more and more hyper-focused on the potential of me having BPD. 

Every conversation was about how I’m not seeing reality and need to start getting treatment for BPD.

A few mornings ago she revealed that the therapy she was referring to wasn’t for her. I’m not sure how long this has been happening but my parents have been engaging with a therapist for months to “correct” my BPD. 

I have a team of experts helping me with my mental health, none of them has ever suggested I have BPD. A few years ago, when my parents first started nonstop talking about me having BPD, I asked my psychiatrist if he suggested a diagnosis and he said it was unnecessary. 

In this house I am treated as though I have BPD. They aren’t listening to me, if I criticize them, I’m crazy. I was raped a few months ago and am still feeling shocked and traumatized. I can’t heal from rape if I’m  constantly on edge and cannot feel safe. 

I talked to a professional, she seemed to agree with me that they were overstepping. I can’t move out but I don’t know how to stop this behaviour. "

659,3,"I've been fighting this thing for a long time and the thing that surprises me every time I make some progress is that there's always another layer of dysfunction just under the one I finally get a handle on. Sometimes more than one. Every time I go through this cycle it feels like starting over but also not. I don't know how to explain it but it's like respawning in a video game only now your character is different, the rules of the game are different, and you're acutely aware of that no matter what you thought the score was, your last life was a complete disaster. I've done this so often that now I'm struggling to find a way to make meaningful amends for my past behavior when people close to me can't trust me and now I don't trust my own perception of reality either.

Has anyone else felt this? Is there an eventual end to it?  "
660,2,"I’ve been struggling with my mental health as long as I could remember. I’ve experienced really bad anxiety since elementary school that turned into more into a depression as I got older. When I was 17, I finally started meds for treatment and long story short, I ended up in the hospital and shortly stopped myself on Effexor which was brutal. 
Fast forward to now, I’ve been taking my mental health a lot more seriously the last year or so. At 24, I bought my first home and that’s when it really sank in, I cannot keep living like this and keep up with daily life. It feels like my mind is a prison, that I’m in a constant fear, always on the look out for something bad to happen. Sometimes I feel a little paranoid. 
Last summer, I unintentionally withdrew from lexapro - the hospital didn’t provide me with it despite me asking (admitted for something physical not mental health). I ended up having a manic episode, and they started to consider my “major depression with reoccurring episodes” is actually just bipolar. 
Since then I’ve been diagnosed with BPD, we are considering bipolar, and was diagnosed with ADHD about a year prior to this. 
Something still didn’t feel quite right, like there was something else going on. I’m not the kind of person who needs labels, but when I was younger my father was very dismissive and said I was lazy when I was struggling so part of me feels like “I’m faking it” without the clinical validation. 
Turns out, I am suffering with PTSD - something I had a feeling about and considered before. But what do I do with that now?
Most of it comes from my childhood. I was forced to essentially be the adult of the household. My parents could speak English well and I am the oldest. My parents worked opposite shifts - mom first, dad third. My dad was an angry, raging alcoholic growing up. He fought in a war before they fled to America. I feel that he definitely struggles with PTSD himself.
As a child, I lived in constant fear. My parents would argue nearly everyday and I can’t count how many times my mom has had to pull shards of glass out of my feet that she missed when cleaning up after my dad’s freak out. She would call my name when she was scared he’d actually hurt her - I’ve had to attempt to pull him off while he choked her out and he’s stabbed her before, etc.
He didn’t lay hands on myself and my siblings as much, but it still happened. We were also constantly verbally and emotionally abused by him. As I got older it just became worse, because it shifted from my mom and him arguing to him and I constantly arguing. 
I can’t remember most of my childhood, just the same terrifying events over and over again. If I hear a man raise his voice, my stomach drops and I freeze. Sometimes scents or certain words or phrases will make me feel the same.
I don’t remember my dreams, but most nights these events play in my head while I lay trying to sleep. I’ll randomly get flooded with these kind of memories and thoughts during my day and I start to shut down. I feel like since my childhood, I’ve also gone through very traumatic events that also have affected me. I feel like I can’t even start to process those things until I can “let go” of what happened to me as a child.
But how do I even do that? When I’m constantly reminded and reliving it? I avoid my parents because it serves as a reminder of what they used to be like. My dad and I actually have an okay relationship now, he has since stopped drinking and my parents actually married a couple years ago to my surprise.
It makes me mad that they can move on and I’m still being haunted. They don’t even remember some of the most traumatic situations they put me through. 
I’m 25 years old but most the time I feel like I’m still that scared 5-10 year old and enraged teenager. It makes me feel like I’m not even myself, that I’m just floating by in life and I’m too stuck in my head to engage with the outside world. I can’t help but get mad - my dad should have went and found how to cope with his own trauma but instead passed it on to me and both my siblings. I feel like I’ve spent my whole life picking up the pieces for all of us. 
How do you even begin to unpack and work through that? I’m so scared of it and myself - I’m scared I’ll give up trying to get through it.

662,2,"TW: attempted rape of a minor

I really really need to get this off my chest, it's been too long........

When I was 15, a man attempted to rape me. I'm an expert in rifles and sniping and was at a camp for armed forces related training (I wont be specific to keep anonymity), and while I was practicing, the supervising officer who was in his mid 40's to late 50's was beginning to get very handsy. He brushed his hands across my breasts while putting on my equipment and protective gear.

When I laid down to get into position, he sat behind me a couple feet away rather than any of the other chairs available. He began to take pictures up my skirt, and neither of the 2 other young men around my age, maybe 17 or 18, attempted to stop him. They turned a blind eye while he put his hand on my lower back as I was on the ground, his entire weight, maybe around 300 pounds, pinning me down. I can't continue the details, nor do I fully remember them due to the traumatic experience.

I managed to escape, thank the Lord. I don't know why he stopped, I would never have been able to fight back as such a petit little girl, but whatever the reason, I thank every God in every universe for mercy.

While at the camp, going around to fulfil my other duties for the next couple weeks, I would see the man riding his bike and making eye contact with me as he passed. I'm haunted by that foul being.

Fast forward another year, I returned to the same camp as a staff member. Despite the trauma, I have a deep passion for sniping and the power I feel as a woman who can do such a traditionally 'manly' job.

Due to the nature of the job and application process (it's hard to explain), he ended up being my boss. I was bound by contract and couldn't leave my position, and I never had the confidence to report him, so he faced no consequences. I was scared every single day, he knew it was me and even said ""Oh you were here last year right? I recognize you!"" I had never been so scared for my life, not that I would die but that I would have to live through my experience every time I came to work for the next couple months.

It's been years now, and I've still been trapped by what happened. I crave violence in sex, I'm scared of men, even the guys I've trusted often end up sexually assaulting me on some level. I don't know how to live like this, being scared of sex but also suffering from hypersexuality due to previous abuse. I want to be a mother but I don't want my children to ever experience the disgusting hands of men.

I need help, so much help, and I wish I could tell the people around me what I went through, but the world I live in as a woman would blame me for wearing a skirt, for not reporting him. I don't know how to move on from all the hurt, how to enjoy my sexuality without needing the abuse or trauma to feel pleasure. I'm scared, but I know one day I will find strength, though that day isn't today."
663,2,"I had an appointment with the VA today, meaning i had to recount everything that happened, again. I’ve done the whole intake/interview thing 5 times in the last year. Everytime the same thing happens and i think its getting worse.

Everytime i bring everything up i get tired, then panicky, then all my symptoms get worse. Ive been fighting disassociation all day. I cant stop repeating what i said. My head hurts so bad. I honestly want to bang it into a wall to relieve the pressure. I know im not gonna sleep tonight, if i do its gomna be nightmares and voices. I feel shaky like i could run at any minute. I cant get help, thats just gonna restart the process.

I also cant help but think if any of this is real. What if im just making it up? What if it really wasnt that bad and im just thinking about it and thats whats making it worse? Same with the symptoms, what if it isnt real? I know im scared of them, so i make them worse by thinking about it. Is this just some sick attempt for sympathy or attention? Maybe im just a baby, because it probably wasnt that bad. Maybe thats why everyone thinks im fine, because i am fine, i just pretend im not? I know those things did happen, i can explain them very factually, i know the experience was real. But the rest is just in my head so i dont know if it is real or if im making it up? I forgot to say some stuff, which means it probably doesnt matter. But it feels like it does. But if i did i would have said something? Why did i forget things. I had a list. 

But i guess it doesnt really matter cause this feeling isnt gonna go away anytime soon. I cant get help. I cant make it stop. I dont know how to feel or whats real or whats not real and whats in my head."
664,2,"Ever since my uh, traumatic event, I've noticed that my limbs, especially my hands started shivering ever so-slightly. Whenever I try to kick back and relax I always feel like I'm moving, either in my head or physically, and when I really focus on it the shivering grows stronger, instead of weakening. 

On one hand, it's not very nice, especially if it's part of this thing, but I'd take it over it being some sort of undiagnosed neurological illness 

Does anyone here experience anything similar? Just an inability to be ""zen"", coupled with tiny but noticeable shaking?"
665,3,"I don't know how to deal with not being able to cohabitate with others. It's really, really bad. I'm 43 and female, and for my entire life I absolutely despise sharing my space with someone else. They could be Jesus Christ, the perfect roommate or romantic partner, and I still hate it. I lived with a boyfriend for 11 years and hated every second of it, so it's not for lack of trying.

When I was a child, I was terrorized by my abusive alcoholic father. The alcoholism wasn't his major problem though. He was just unusually cruel and evil even when he wasn't drinking. So, the only time I ever felt safe as a child was when I was alone. If no one was there, no one could hurt me.

I've been very sick with cancer for the past 3 years (multiple myeloma) and I almost died before we found a treatment that worked and put me in remission. I gave up my safe space where I lived alone in a small apartment to move into a nice house with my boyfriend who took care of me.

Fast forward to this year, he overdosed on a cocktail of drugs and dropped a bag of fentanyl-laced cocaine into my hand as he left with the EMTs, and now I'm left reeling over the fact that he has lied to me for months about drug abuse among other things I won't get into here.

So, it's not safe for me to live in my house with my now-ex-boyfriend but my cPTSD will not allow me to move in with someone else. I need my own space. But I have to get a job which can take months. I need to sell off a small plot of off-grid land to put something in my bank account.

The cancer will come back because that's just how multiple myeloma works but I don't know when. The ballpark is 6 months to a year, then I'll have to do another treatment which might debilitate me to the point where I can't maintain a job. \*edit: I'm already on SSDI (disability). I'm starting outpatient day treatment for cPTSD today. I am so exhausted and the last thing I want is to be around people. Having to share space with someone who has betrayed my trust is consuming me.

Is there anyone else out there who is like me? Did you ever find a way to cope with living with other people? I feel like I'm having a nightmare and I can't wake up."
666,2,"i stopped smoking weed not too long ago, i’m trying to have better control of my life and find healthier coping mechanisms, despite smoking lots of weed ive always had bad nightmares about the time i was in a catholic elementary school, i was being badly bullied and physically/sexually abused by my peers from about the 1st grade to the 6th, my memory is bad and i can barely remember anything in detail but its like my body knows it all. i’m a very angry person and im terrible with my emotions, im scared of feeling feelings i cant even identify them; and i want nothing more than to get better but its like im unable to. my body is stuck in that time and my mind feels like multiple different people. i want to be the best person i can be but it feels impossible. i’m only 19 though so i guess i have time but i dont know how much more of this i can take i go to therapy i take medication i do it all and its not enough i dont know how you older people do it man i want to get better. i dont even know if i have ptsd but i mean hey i cant go back to that school i dream about it over and over i fear certain things and sometimes i remember it so clearly i feel like i cant breathe. i want to get better"
667,1,"Hi
I doubt this will be a useful post to anyone. But i have no one to talk to or.. no one that will listen. I'm all alone in this.

Grew up with an uncle that was crazy. No one in my family liked him, but they still dropped me off at his place from the time i was 13 years old.

He was high as a kite all day long on a mixture of things. 
Anyway, he would rutineley beat me, choke me (sometimes till i lost conciousness) he would shoot at me, throw knives at me, force me to do humiliating rituals while threatening me with a weapon, drug me and rape me.
He put drugs in my food and drink (which has made me paranoid about food and drink to this day)
He also threatened to kill me if i told anyone about the things he did to me.

But worst of all was the mental manipulation and gaslighting.
He had a knack for figuring out peoples weaknesses and insecurities.
He took this to the extreme and by the end he had convined me i was psychotic, ""crazy"" and that i could not trust my own thoughts. 
I remember distintcly seeing s fly flying across the room and yet i did not dare believe it was there.
So to say the least it took YEARS to rebuild mentally to the degree its been possible after all this.
And for many years he managed to isolate me from other people in my life. Which kept it going longer and enabled him to go ""all in""

Since i've been so alone in this, i wonder: 

- do these experiences justify my feeling severe trauma and struggling in daily life? 

Thanks

Edit: not sure i chose the correct flair

668,3,"Hey everyone, I'm in my mid-40s and trying to make sense of a really difficult period in my life. I recently left a very abusive relationship with someone diagnosed with sociopathy and delusional disorder. On top of that, for the past five years at work, I was dealing with intense burnout due to unbelievable hours and demands.

I started to feel myself shutting down last summer (2024), pushed through it, but then had a complete breakdown in December 2024. I haven't felt the same since. I'm currently off work on long-term disability, which I'm incredibly grateful for.

A clinical psychologist initially diagnosed me with PTSD, but a psychiatrist recently added diagnoses of borderline personality disorder and ADHD, linking the BPD to the intensive childhood abuse I suffered from my mother. I don't really want to go into the details of my childhood, but it was rough.

The psychiatrist also told me that my PTSD is very severe – like one of the highest he's ever clinically seen. Honestly, I feel like I'm regressing to my teenage years but worse . I'm struggling to get anything done, I don't care about much, I've had thoughts of self-harm and suicide (though I haven't acted on them), and I snap at everyone around me.

I'm trying to understand why I had this complete collapse. For my whole life, I've always been able to push through anything and everything. Now, even the thought of stress feels unbearable, and my psychiatrist has told me I need to reduce all stress in my life. Given all of this, and how complex everything feels with the PTSD, BPD, and ADHD, I'm seriously considering medical retirement because I don't know if I can ever handle the demands of my very high-stakes career again.

Being diagnosed with BPD in my mid-40s has been a bit of a shock. In some ways, it makes a lot of sense when I look back at my life, but it's also really scary.

I'm really just hoping to hear from everyone's personal experiences if you've gone through something similar – dealing with trauma, burnout, and these kinds of diagnoses, and how it led to a significant breakdown. Any insights or advice would be appreciated. I'm feeling pretty lost and overwhelmed right now."
669,1,"A couple of days ago, I got triggered badly, and with it, so many memories came back to me. I dissociate bad so my memory is awful but I remember so much now from when I was with my ex from almost a decade ago now, it’s awful years worth of memory the person I use to be and what she did to me and made me do and (now that I have grown and healed what I could years and years and finally last year starting therapy but when I came out as trans I choose a different name but now I’ve split my thoughts into those things I did to avoid punishment was (my dead name)’s fault not me) and I feel bad I pushed everyone in my life away because there were punishments if I didn’t. I don’t know how I am just supposed to just come to terms with this I don't remember everything everything but almost every hit, every punishment, every insult during that time I’m so blessed that I’ve found worth in my life because before now this would have been more than too much, but I feel so hollow now and I don’t know what to do I feel like I’m just waiting and existing till my next therapy appointment.

Sorry, this is mainly a vent. I just don't have many people I trust enough to talk about this stuff, and saying it here makes it feel a little better, like getting a small bit off my chest."
670,3,"I'm just so upset. I keep wanting normal nights sleep. I keep trying different medications. Alas, I go to bed, have a nightmare directly related to my trauma, and wake up in a puddle of sweat and piss (because I've started bedwetting), heart rate of 150, and dissociated for the next two hours while my body tries to readjust.

 I feel like this should be bearable for me. It's been two years since it happened. Why haven't I adapted? I've tried every medical intervention. I've made breakthroughs in therapy. My panic attacks have been greatly reduced, I don't flinch much if at all anymore, I no longer blame myself. But still, the nightmares are just as bad. They make it hard to finish my degree and they make it hard to go to work. 

I just want one normal nights rest where I won't be thrown into the deep end of trauma and then wake up needing a shower and to change my sheets. I'm so tired of it. I'm tired of needing hours for my body to readjust. 

I want to go on prazosin but there's medication interactions and honest to god, I think I'm at the point where I'd prefer physical symptoms or death just to get a good night's sleep."
671,1,"I dont have an emergency contact when my back problem was caused by parents or guardians, maybe not even that such as to be left to stay the night someplace at childcare, not only did i get hung like a pinata 🪅 i wore a red shirt on a bull corral and let him out, i was struck a few times idk how many, i was knocked off the corral, that could've been worst of all. This happened when i was very young, i cant seem to find help, there were shootings and drug abuse also. Lots of drugs, i saw lots of body bags in lakes in various places, private park community lakes. A guy was shot trying to pull one out and open it. Smh god rest his sole"
672,2,"I’ve been releasing a lot of trauma lately and my body feels unusually calm. Also, my mind is not racing with thoughts like it usually does. This has made me extremely uncomfortable. I’m so used to my mind being filled with triggers that this feels super unfamiliar. Anyone else dealing with this? I also get angry too, like it’s not normal for me to be relaxed even though it’s a good thing for me to be. "
673,1,"So I just started therapy due to several things related to my rape three years ago since I haven't moved on yet and one of the things I need to talk about even though it's completely outrageous

the thing is that I've been feeling attracted to potential abusers or  alleged sex offenders. I feel awful and guilty. I casually said this to some of my friends and after some time they pointed this out and mentioned like it was a coincidence. So I wanted to know how common is this and why after such traumatic event I feel sexual desire to these type of ppl even. I really feel like a terrible person and also one of my friends unaware of my situation made a joke about it and i felt like a monster "
674,1,"Has anyone else felt like this? How do you come to terms with it?

And for those of you who are parents with bipolar and ptsd—how do you navigate the challenges of raising a child while managing your mental health?

I’m 24, and honestly, I’ve never really pictured myself having kids. Part of it is because I’m still figuring out how to manage my bipolar and ptsd, and the other part is the fear of passing this on—genetically or emotionally. Sometimes I like to imagine myself being happily married with kids, living a peaceful, stable life. It’s a nice thought—but the moment I start to picture it too clearly, fear creeps in. I’m scared I’ll never be emotionally safe enough to give that to someone else, let alone a child.

I also work in a hospital, and I know this might sound harsh, but I feel a sense of dread when I’m assigned to patients with unmanaged bipolar disorder. They’re often the most aggressive and difficult cases, especially on 12-hour night shifts when things are already unpredictable.

I still feel empathy for them—but in healthcare, you get desensitized just to get through the shift. We’ll be casually chatting while bagging a body or trying to calm down a patient screaming at the wall. From the outside, it probably looks unfeeling, but it’s just how we survive the job.

What gets to me most is realizing how progressive this disorder is. Seeing it play out in real-time at work makes me wonder—will that be me one day?

There’s also the fear of pregnancy itself. I rely on multiple medications to function, and the idea of having to come off them if I were to get pregnant is terrifying. I’ve only just started to stabilize. What would happen if I lost that progress?

Growing up, my home environment was really unstable. My dad had serious anger issues and I was physically abused by my nanny (having nanny’s was a cultural norm in the country I grew up in). My parents never believed me when I said I was depressed, and that kind of upbringing left me with disorganized attachment and a fear that I could repeat those same patterns with a child of my own.

After I was hospitalized and sent to the psych unit, something changed. My dad and I have actually become really close since then. He’s softened a lot and has shown genuine regret for the past. I truly appreciate how much he’s tried to make things right. But even with that healing, I still worry deep down that I could become like that too—and that thought haunts me.

I want to be normal. I want to enjoy my 20s like everyone else, but most days it feels like I’m just surviving—working and sleeping with no energy for anything else. Everything feels paused. I don’t know if I’ll ever become the version of myself that could handle parenting—or if it’s selfish to even consider it."
675,3,"I did a Genesight pharmaceutical genetic test. They did a cheek swab and sent my psychiatrist the results. I had her print them for me so I can do research but I get overwhelmed and SOOO confused trying to understand genotypes and phenotypes and my risk levels. There is just so much information all at once and I'm not trained in medicine at all... (the Google rabbit hole is real and very terrifying). I keep focusing on the catastrophic reactions I have listed and the depressing information like ""significantly low levels- intervention may be required ""

I guess the advice I'm looking for is:
1. How do I read the information given?
2.would I be able to go to someone medically trained to help me read it?
3. HIPPA issues with sharing on the internet I definitely DO NOT want to do that...
4. Will this information impact how I manage my body and specifically, how?"

Something is happening later this week that I know will trigger me to some extent & my brain is even more chaotic than usual. The “thing” is absolutely a good thing & something I want to happen, I just wish my brain would sort itself out.


I also recently finished a book where two of the protags were living with the longterm impact of trauma & I miss them. Their trauma is totally different to mine but I still felt seen, I suppose.

677,1,"CW: physical abuse/DV, mentions of suicide threats, financial abuse, emotional abuse, verbal abuse

I’ve had several abusive housing situations in the last few years, 3/4 of which were physically abusive. A couple weeks ago, my roommate had a manic episode and >!choked me!< after I went into his room to retrieve something he took from me. The cops told me it was my fault and that I was the aggressor because I had went into his room. Even though I was the only one with injuries and they had to call EMS for me, they charged us both because they said we were just fighting.

After they left, my roommate kept laughing at me and said I was a liar and also saying I had lied about past abuse. I don’t remember much of it, but I completely lost control of my body and >!attacked him.!< I’ve never done that before, not when he >!choked me,!< or when others have physically/verbally attacked me. I didn’t know I was capable of it. He called the cops again, and they came and arrested me because I said I wanted a lawyer. My brother eventually convinced them to let me go if he brought me away from the apartment for the night. I haven’t been back since.

This happened right after the one-year anniversary of when a former roommate crawled on top of me while I was lying in bed and >!bit me.!< (This is what my current roommate was saying I had lied about.) Again in this situation, the cops also charged us both because they said we were fighting, even though I was the only one with injuries. This same roommate had forcibly outed me to my family. I think about her every day. I still have a scar from the bite. I hold so much anger toward her.

The other abusive situation my current roommate said I had lied about was the one I experienced right before him, where my roommate told me she was going to >!kill herself!< if she got evicted, knowing this would make me pay her rent. I did for two months because I was so afraid she was serious. I would have nightmares of finding her >!dead.!< Every time I walked in the house or knocked on her door I was convinced I would find her >!dead.!< When I couldn’t pay her rent anymore, she told me I didn’t care about her life and said a lot of other really hurtful things.

I moved back in with my dad and stepmom. My stepmom was the first instance of physical abuse. It only happened a couple times but after the second time, she had called the cops and said I attacked her (presumably to add weight to the story she told my dad) and the cops yelled at me and cursed at me and told me I would go to jail if I didn’t stop lying to them. They charged me with domestic assault (it was dropped).

In the past week, my stepmom has taunted me when my dad isn’t around (sometimes when he is around), called me >!dumb/stupid/a b*tch,!< told my dad that I lied about the abuse from her and others, and tried to perform exorcisms on me/my dad (she does this as a way to win arguments, but she is 100% serious about it, says the devil is in us and she screams at it to leave, etc).

My entire life feels like a nightmare. It has ever since I moved in with the roommate who >!outed/bit me.!< Every time I think things might get better, they get worse in ways I couldn’t have possibly imagined. I feel so dark and empty. I’m dissociating constantly. My memories don’t feel like they’re mine. I feel like my whole life is cursed and I have no idea how to cure myself. I need someone to tell me they believe me, or just be honest with me and tell me they think I’m insane/lying."
678,2,"This is messy and probably unreasonable. 

My husband's family is very wealthy. Long story short I was in the acute stage of PTSD after a compounded trauma last year and was working closely with my psychiatrist. I was not in a great place, but trying my best. Husband offered a one way ticket to visit our home state for some r&r. I gratefully accepted. 

Jetlagged, grieving, and trying not to be a burden to anyone is how I came in. 

Long story short, less than a day after landing husband orchestrated a kidnapping/attempted forced hospitalization of me. It could have been an episode of it's always sunny in Philadelphia as It was equally traumatizing and in retrospect, comidically bad. It didn't work, I literally just walked away. 

I've got my ptsd more or less treated, obviously husband and I are on the rocks. His family lives to gossip. I've heard his immediate family say I'm schizophrenic, demon possessed, and have multiple personality disorder along with psychosis. I listened in the same room with my husband on speaker phone just slack jawed as he corrected absolutely no one. So obviously I'm no contact, but my father in law also disowned my kids and I. 

My husband's family is deeply enmeshed, FIL isn't doing well health wise. My husband is the favorite of two heirs. They had a phone call I didn't feel comfortable with.

I didn't want my young son in the room while my husband spoke with his dad. I've expressed concern over my kids hearing how they talk about me, my husband kept shoeing me away as I tried to call my youngest out of the room. 

Immediately after the phone call idk, I maybe had a panic attack? I was shaking, heart beating fast. After the phone call I asked my husband to go stay at a hotel. I packed his stuff, he left in a huff. We've been teetering divorce for a year, this is probably the 3rd time I've asked him to leave. 

I don't think I can do it. That experience in my home state was living an honest conspiracy theory in real time. It was secondary trauma. I genuinely thought I was going crazy I was so scared. 

My husband even talking to his dad sends me right back. The entire time my husband and his dad were on the phone orchestrating the entire thing. 

I'm not reasonable, right? It's his dad. It's his relationship with his dad. And yet it triggers me. "
679,0,"For those of you who have felt significant (or not significant, any, really) progress in therapy. I’m just wondering what therapy looks like to you? Do you share your traumas? Do you do everything but share your traumas because it’s too painful? Do you touch on it a little then run away? Do you talk about your day to day struggles? Do you just cry? 

I’m sure it’s a combination of all of the above but I just wanted to know what’s helped for other people? what’s effective for you? "
680,1,"I have a number of diagnoses and was recently prescribed Wellbutrin, but I find that it's messing with my sleep and giving me stomach problems. And doing nothing for my PTSD. I was on sertraline before but it stopped working sadly."
681,1,"This is a cry for help


I’m going to write my story here because it is my last ditch attempt to find help for what I’ve been experiencing. I’ve spent years getting various diagnoses between generalized anxiety, major depressive disorder, PTSD and none of them really captured what I truly have experienced. I always believed that I had a good childhood. There was food on the table, clean clothes on my back, a nice home to grow up in. Only recently in therapy (IFS) have I begun to learn about the fact that I have compartmentalized the abuse I endured in my younger years. I won’t go into too much detail about it here, but there was physical and emotional abuse from my mother for many years. I would be locked in my bedroom and would have to pound on the door in order to be let out to use the bathroom. I would have to run away from her and jump down staircases until she’d finally reach me and grab my hair in knots through her clenched teeth. My father was my respite but he suffered from alcoholism. He was emotionally and sometimes physically unavailable. I do remember a few times where he’d protect me from her- one of them required him to physically peel her body off of me while she hurled punches at my face. When she refused to get off of me, he punched her. I’ll never forget that image. When I was 14 my father gave up. To put it simply, he hung himself in our basement and I was the lucky one who found him. 

Fast forward to now- 29 years old. Just leaving an abusive relationship in which I was engaged but so deeply attached. Despite the abuse, he was my sense of safety. I am proud that I was able to leave. I am grateful for that. The problem is that I replaced him immediately with one man after another. Both of these relationships did not work out, and they both respectfully and kindly chose to step back from me- one stating that they just weren’t ready for a relationship (he was struggling with his own mental health issues including DID), and the other one telling me that he felt as though I was still too entangled in my past engagement for a relationship (I still own a home with the ex and have a restraining order on him). Both of these men were reasonable, and their reasoning for leaving me was VALID. I can fully see that. But when each of these situations occurred, it truly feels like im 14 again, in the basement, begging my father not to leave. It isn’t just a mental thing either- it’s physical too. My vision changes, my body shakes, my heart races. This lasts for WEEKS. It isn’t what I’d imagine a “ptsd flashback” to look like, it’s all encompassing and lasts for extended periods of time. I found myself begging these men to talk to me, give me a chance to explain myself; let me prove why im worth staying for. And the worst part is im WATCHING myself do it. It feels like I have no control. Both of these men ended up blocking me, rightfully so. And I made fake numbers just to reach them and continue to beg, worsening the shame. Then the voices come about how I fucked everything up, obviously they left you, you are insane, and the worst one “YOU NEED TO FIX THIS”. Which in turn makes me reach out AGAIN. And the cycle repeats. I feel like I am living in my own personal, self curated hell. I have lost 30 pounds over the last 6 months. When I try to feed my body, the thoughts come about how I don’t even deserve to eat. I truly do not know how I can continue to live like this. I feel like a burden to my friends and family, because no one knows how to help me. I’m met with “just don’t text them!”. And most of them do not realize that it’s a compulsion, a survival tactic I must’ve learned in my younger years. One that did serve a purpose of protecting me at one point, and now it’s killing me. I have no sense of safety within myself. I own a home, I live alone, I have a job saving lives- and I can’t even save myself. If anyone is reading this that understands this pain, I am so sorry that you have to experience this. this is something i wouldnt wish on my worst enemy. i view myself as a strong person- ive overcome addiction and ive fought to get out of the old life i lived and i truly do not want to sound as though im drowning in self pity. but i am absolutely suffering. if anyone has any experience or guidance for me, please let me know. and yes i am in therapy- i am finally starting to face these traumas and it seems like its helping but it is bringing all of my trauma back to light."
682,2,"Basically, what the title says. 
It's just that umpropmtedly I have thoughts/fantasies about being raped or harrased, or being physically used in general and physically it arouses me but mentally makes me uncomfortable. My family and especially my mom had always been sex positive, to the point that I don't remember an exact point in which I learned what menstruation, sex, pregnancy, masturbation and topics like this were.

I don't remember exactly but when I was between 6-10, I was playing truth or dare with other children and a boy asked me if I masturbated, and on the topic I feel I did start penetrative masturbation too early? I can't tell if before or after I got my first period which happened just months before I got ten. Also, I'm not sure how I came to that conclusion but even before I felt actual attraction to anybody I've been out of the closet as bisexual.

The thing is, barely even have memories of my childhood, and most of the ones I remember are concerning or events that affect me even to this day that come out when I concentrate on the topic, also, I have no memories of ever being catcalled, touched or anything of the sort, but I still feel there's something wrong relating to this topic."
683,1,"I am sharing my story as im trying to help myself..childhood was great it wasn't until high school that I started experiencing abuse.. my abuse was at home  then I was teased,  rejected,  bullied in school.. men rejected me. Suffered more rejection and abuse. My story is detailed as my friend has said I've had n9 escape..my worse trauma happened in 2012 where I was severely abused physically,  took care of it I was not myself and became agoraphobia. Had an abortion at 27 biggest regret.  Latest events abuse from clients,  my husband leaving for 5 days for his job and he's my rock.  Wanting a family so bad, to give my husband a baby bit knowing it won't happen. Wanting t9 improve myself not go backwards..feeling so much. Wanting help but afraid to lose people but If I don't ill lose people too. I blame myself for everything "
684,1,"I'm new here but am posting instead of lurking finally. I'm 54 and my diagnoses have been all over the place between chronic depression, anxiety, adhd, and currently C-PTSD. My childhood was awful. My mother is a survivor of nightmarish trauma from her childhood and was absent more often than not. My father embodies a number of textbook aspects of narcissism and sociopathic tendencies in addition to being an unrepentant lifelong substance abuser, a rapist (not confirmed but probably both of my sisters), and a general scumbag. I grew up dysfunctional as all get out and coped the best I could by creating an everlasting gobstopper shell of defensive and offensive measures to survive. I also developed an eating disorder very early in life and abused alcohol myself starting at about 15. I'm 5 months sober as I type this. I've been sober for much longer stretches but never in a way that feels as meaningful as it feels now. The desire is gone and the triggers don't have any effect anymore. I've also located the root cause of my eating disorder and have effectively rewired it, at least as far as the last few months have gone. I've had several cycles of improvement as I've made incremental progress in the past and at this point it's impossible for me to trust that this iteration represents long term change.

I've been in some form of therapy for most of my life but about 4 years ago I found EMDR. It helped my wife massively and I started seeing her therapist and we quickly made dramatic progress. The first session cleared a foundational trauma in me that unblocked so much that I was basically a cognitive vegetable for  a couple weeks. There was so much rewiring going on that I couldn't process anything else. Several sessions later with remediation between deep dives and here I am. In a sense massively better, but also in the worst phase of my entire life.

This all started when I was 5 years old so for the last 40 years I lived a completely absurd, assholish, brash, obnoxious douche life. At least that's what I know it to be now. Up to now I've believed myself to be someone completely different than my outward behavior let on. You could say that I gaslit myself as much as I did the people around me. And everytime things went wrong, that disconnect fed the cycle some more. Because I was ""ok"" and ""different than my parents"" and ""working on it"", I excused my behavior and even took a victim role when things would go sideways because of my behaviors. When I ended the EMDR session where this came into HD focus for the first time, I collapsed into myself with shame and embarrassment and jumped into a dissociative hole devoid of emotions. I'm coming out of that hole right now but at the cost of my marriage. 

My wife of 15 years let me know yesterday that she was leaving, and for a good reason. Several months ago, at the peak of my dissociation and just as I had sobered up, she told me that she was legitimately suicidal. At the time I didn't want to accept that I was the cause, that my dysfunctional behavior and substance abuse was mixing with my inability to trust and bond with my own wife to make her existence hellish. I can't ignore or explain away or rationalize it anymore. I wasn't a healthy partner when we met, and even though I'm comparatively better now, even if I might be an ok partner now, I'm 15 years late to make up for any of it. 

And that's why I'm here. In some ways I'm in the best shape of my life. In others things have never been worse. I understand how my coping mechanisms have corrupted my behaviors and am actively rewiring them, but I don't know how to adequately, meaningfully apologize for how I've treated my wife or how to try and make amends. I don't have the desire to abuse any substances, but I'm more depressed right now than I have been in a very long time. And the worst part, I feel like I've made legitimate progress on multiple fronts, but I'm acutely aware of how many times in the past that nothing lasting has come of short term changes. 

I'm a complete mess right now. 

Edit: I forgot to add that I don't trust myself anymore, I don't trust my perception of reality at all. I know enough about how my particular coping mechanisms to doubt my own eyes. 

I also forgot to ask my questions: Am I even in the right place? If so, has anyone else gone through anything similar? If not, any suggestions on where I might go for some conversation, feedback, and potential commiseration?"
685,1,"When I was 6 my mom jerked me off and  I hated myself for it because she made me think it was what I wanted and then it happened I remember stating to her I think a peice of me just died and the look of confusion and on her face is burned in my mind she was insecure and couldn't think of why I wouldn't just see what she did as a plus side of the clotheness of our relationship this is the 3rd time she joked at me she said all you boys are the same always leading your mother's on she winked Im pretty sure I went to her in first place probably just to sit with her late at night because my dad had just fallen asleep in the bed so I walked to the living room to cuddle wwatch TV with her  and maybe just get some comfort from my sometimes overly critical dad but instead she raped me Ive had to re remember remembering 3 times but the last time I talked to people about it and they said theyd watch out for any mental regressions I remember explaining to them that I think my brain is trying to protect me by not letting me remember certain things because of the emotional abuse in that home i talked to more extended family and sadly my friends who at 14 and 15s best options were to stay away from me because I was just triggered all the time and flipping shit but now I've got my aunt and her family as my family and I feel like I can go out and do things I moved here after

686,2,"For context, I (26M) dated my ex-GF online for an entire year mid 2023 - 2024 (we never met in person), and after I broke things off she consistently tried contacting/harassing me for almost 10 months even despite blocking her on everything. At this point, there has been 3 months of no contact between us. Throughout the relationship, my ex was very emotionally abusive towards me at times, calling me the most horrible names, treating me as if I'm stupid, gaslighting, guilt-tripping, unfriending/blocking me for hours, you name it. I've always struggled with a very low self-image, so you can probably imagine that being my nightmare scenario. I suspect she may have had BPD with narcissistic traits (according to conversations I've had with Grok, but AI language models are never entirely accurate anyway).

Fast forward to today, I've been dating my current girlfriend for nearly 9 months, as she is my first in-person relationship. To note, she has been an absolutely amazing partner in every way, and definitely the one I want to marry one day. Anyways, she just landed back in the city from a flight, and I told her ""Welcome home"" with a heart emoji and she responded with ""Huh?"" So immediately my heart and mind are both racing, and I'm overthinking everything, every little detail and not being able to piece together what I may have done wrong. I respond with ""Is everything okay?"". She leaves me on read for about 10 minutes and responds with ""What do you mean by food?"" referencing a previous snap I responded to before welcoming her back home. At this point I am panicking, thinking I have definitely messed up and must have upset her, thinking back to the horrible things my ex said to me. So I explained what I meant about my response to the snap, and apologized to her profusely.

This was her response ""Ohhhh bahaha I totally forgot about that I was so confused"" followed by words of comfort and reassuring me she wasn't upset."

This is important for this post : I am a nursing intern so i cannot treat patients and theres a ton of rules basically what i did was against the law but i got to keep my internship because of the circumstance. (Yes i know what i did was stupid as shit but i dont care i wasnt just going to watch it all happen like the others were.)

A few weeks ago the ER was swamped and two doctors had been on vacation plus we already didnt have enough nurses so we were extremely understaffed and unprepared. A 6 year old showed up with cardiac tamponade and the doctors were busy so after everyone standing around life idiots for a good 30 seconds i decided to step in and do what i could (i did everything correct and temporarily saved her) she made it all the way to the fucking hospital just to die 20 minutes later right as the doctor showed up. I know i did what i could with the knowledge i had but (insert full scenario here i don’t want to type it all) she ended up in a-systole and i did absolutely everything i could nothing worked i was trying to save her for 15 minutes before getting pulled off her my the shift lead and the doctor i just fell to the floor sobbing and i just well broke i watched her fucking die in my hands what did i do wrong how did she make it all the way to this shitty hospital to die. 

I keep having really bad nightmares and for the first week i basically didn’t sleep when i did i was immediately woken up. How do i make it stop how do i get the sounds out of my fucking head that fucking monitor noise is driving me nuts and when i fall asleep i just keep reliving it in fucked up ways. I just want to sleep peacefully. I haven’t been back to the hospital since and i don’t think i can go back. 

I need help but i cant afford my therapist this week and i want to feel anything else but this it feels like im cracking under it all (theres so much going on i dont even have the energy to get into for this post) my hair is fucking greying and im only 20. 

What do i do? How do i get past this without going completely insane? Please help me.

Update : thank you all so much im currently working on getting help through the hospital just a ridiculous amount of bureaucratic hoops. Im going to be taking a break from my internship for a few weeks at the end of which im going to decide if this is right for me. Im also going to talk to the school and hospital to totally remove the ER from my rotation (i already did most of the hours for it) so i can focus on what i want to do and what i have enjoyed despite the toll. Again thank you so much for the support❤️"
688,1,"I was severely abused and neglected before being all together abandoned as a kid. This led me into even further abusive relationships and trauma later on. It’s taken most of my adult life to start breaking cycles, and I recently got my diagnosis. For some reason, it made me really angry. I understood I had a lot of trauma, and that led to anxiety and depression, but I think the diagnosis really hit me with how deep it’s actually affected me. It pissed me off, all I could think about was about how much they took from me. "
689,1,"Just over a year ago I experienced a traumatic attack. My family (younger sister and my mom) and I (23F) were renting a cottage on a farm which is pretty secluded. One night around midnight, I was laying in my bed watching a movie with my sister (17F) sleeping next to me, when I heard footsteps that sounded like someone coming from downstairs up. I thought it was my mom as she had fell asleep on the couch downstairs. When I looked up, 5 men entered my room with weapons (sword, axe, skew driver, knife) and masks. I immediately screamed which woke up my mom downstairs and my sister. When all the lights turned on and with everyone gathered in the same room, my mom started fighting them and I jumped in to defend her. They pepper sprayed us which then calmed everyone down as we were all struggling to breathe, and my mom and I were struggling so see. They tied all of our hands and feet and sat us in a corner. It was then that I noticed blood on myself and my mom. I got cut on my shoulder and thigh while my mom had a major cut on the back of her head, which we suspect was caused by the axe during the fight. We were guarded by two men while the other three went through our house to take anything they could find. While sitting there, all that was going through my mind was the possibility have being murdered brutally or raped or having to witness that happen to my mom and sister. Fortunately after about 45min, they decided to take what they wanted and left, we didn't get physically injured any further. Once we through lt they were for sure out of the house and on the run, we ran to the car and drove to the owner of the farm who the called the police.

We were in a pretty bad financial situation at the time so everything they took couldn't be recovered from insurance and we went to a public hospital for our injuries since we have no medical aid. I'm a uni student and it was the time of my exams so I had to direct my focus and manage to not have the incident impact my academics. I didn't have the finances for proper support or even realise the effect that this experience would have on me in the long run.

I never really talk about it to anyone afterwards and kind of unintentionally shoved it down. My girlfriend (25F) and I started having communication problems and the same fight over and over. I noticed changes in my behaviour and thoughts but at the time didn't at all consider that it could be because of my PTSD from the trauma. 

We broke up over 2 months ago after a 2 year relationship and I'm really struggling to accept it. She said that her reason for breaking up with me was because she was tired of fighting over the same things and not feeling appreciated for her understanding and patience. I will admit that even though I was tired of the fighting too, I knew I had a big part in it and acknowledged that I did struggle with communicating. I didn't know why I struggle to articulate my thoughts into sentences or not get heavily overwhelmed when confronted with something. We never really talked about my PTSD being a contributing factor to this problem which I deeply regret. I don't want to invalidate her feeling of being hurt, but fear that she saw it as a red flag of mine and not as a phycological issue I was experiencing as a result of a recent traumatic encounter - and if I'm being honest, I too felt the same about myself in a way.

I only tapped into doing research about PTSD and the symptoms of it after we broke up. It has cleared up a lot of things to me which I wish I could express to her but she has made it clear to stick with her decision of separating. Our relationship was amazing before the trauma, and I know we still love each other deeply. I didn't mean to make her feel hurt by thinking my destructive behaviours would become a toxic pattern. I myself didn't know what was going on at the time. 

We have spoken since the break up over the phone. She doesn't want to see me in person as she says she's not ready and she doesn't know when she ever will be. I said my last goodbye text and everything I wanted to say to ensure her that I do appreciate everything she has done for me, but the trauma really got the best of me. I understand that I have to work on my healing with this and I started therapy and reflection work, I just wish it didn't cost my relationship for me to see that I suffer from PTSD.

I comfort myself by telling myself that just as I wasn't prepared to experience something like that, she was not prepared to support me through it. We're both quite young and I think that eventhough she tried her best to love me the way she thought I wanted, she kept getting hurt because it was not what I needed - but even I myself didn't know what I needed.

I can't imagine spending the rest of my life with someone else but I do understand that we have to go our separate ways now. I do hope that our paths will cross again in the future when we both have grown and maybe we'll be better equipped to maintain some sort of relationship ( romantic or friendly) with each other then.

What are your thoughts on this and how I'm handling it?
Any advice for healing with PTSD and letting go of someone who you know you could make it work with despite external circumstances?
Is it naive of me to think that she will reconsider her decision once she realises that our problems were because of external and uncontrollable circumstances that we could work on?"

For context, I experienced a traumatic event almost 6 months ago and since then I have not stopped thinking about it. Not constantly, but I don’t know a day where it hasn’t popped into my head atleast once. It used to be worse, but has started to settle down. I used to be triggered by things that reminded me of the event, and I used to try and avoid them. I’ve since gotten better, but I can’t say it still doesn’t happen. I’ve had a couple of flashbacks before, and occasionally I’ll remember things vividly if triggered / out of the blue.

My question is, is it worth starting the diagnostic process? I know people lack the ability to self-evaluate and be aware of the true extent of their issues, however I really do not feel like it’s bad enough to make it worth the hassle of booking a GP appointment. I can cope without (despite what friends seem to think) Has it actually helped anyone in getting it?"
692,2,"I've had PTSD for years and im in a relatively good state of recovery. I can function day to day pretty well, but i have been constantly suffering from tactile hallucinations for years. I can't seem to work through it.

I'd like some advice and techniques anyone has picked up over time to deal with them please

Here is a list:

Bugs: I know this one is common, i feel fleas crawling and biting my skin. I know they're not real but when it gets bad, i can feel them all over my body, its very intense. sometimes i also see visual black dots that jump around when it gets very bad

This is my most common one, and longest, it actually has a trigger to it. It's gotten better over the years, but the only things i've found have helped is some anti-histamines, but they seem to dull it more then anything

  
these ones have appeared recently over the last month or two:

Needles: I have a slight fear of needles, but i've been hallucinating very fine needles being stabbed into my legs, and under my nails. This hallucination i have found bit of a solution for, which is pretending to take the needles out and placing them into a all next to me through my minds eye. either way, very distressing

  
nose thing: i've had this hallucination a few times of something very sharp in my nose poking around. it took my a while to figure out this was actually a hallucination. It's started to morph since i figured that out, now i keep imaging and feeling bugs crawling around. i have no solution for this, it just freaks me out

  
burning: i know this is a very common sensation too, but i have no trauma with heat or fire, i just feel patch of skin on fire. When i place my hand on it, it stops, but it keeps coming back. I've only had this one once



I'm concerned that im developing new types of tactile hallucinations. 90% of the time if i was hallucinating, it was just the fleas. Any insight into why new types would develop out of no where, and without a trigger (or at least not an obvious one) would be nice.

thank you "
693,0,Has anybody tried these? Are they worth it?

698,2,"My history is that I was pretty violently abused by a dentist when I was a teenager. I suffer from PTSD as a result. The thought of getting dental care has always scared me to my core. I found out I needed to do a crown and I just about lost it. I have flashbacks even getting a cleaning, let alone going through a more involved dental procedure. At the same time I was scared of losing my tooth if I ignored it. I did a TON of therapy and worked with the therapist to create a step by step game plan for getting through the crown. I had a bag with me full of all kinds of sensory items to play with, I did nervous system regulation exercises for days before the appointment. Having a support person with me helped a lot as well. Not going to lie, I thought I would be running out of there. Everything I did for myself worked. I was able to get through the appointment without a major flashback. I was uncomfortable at times, but I didn’t have that major trauma reaction I’ve had in the past. I never thought I could do something like this, I’m really proud of myself. Thought I would share with a community that understands how difficult things like this are. I’ve found people in my life who don’t have PTSD don’t understand. "
699,1,"Hello, sorry for dumping this. I'm a 22 year old guy. I've gone through a rough childhood. I'd been severely bullied by every one of my friends. One of which was sexual over some time. I was physically and mentally abused by my parents and teachers. 

All of this has left a deep deep scar on me. I'm afraid of interacting with people. No matter how hard I try, I can neither trust anybody nor feel any connection with anybody. It hurts that at my age I see men enjoying their time with their partners, and I can't even look in the eye with anybody. I workout, so it's not like I don't care for myself. But nothing helps. "
700,2,"TW: S.A.

For the past several months it feels like I’ve been getting back memories that I’ve blocked out since childhood. Mainly, my father coming into my room at night and molesting me. I’m 25 and don’t know what’s happening. It started as a random flashback while my coworker had a true crime podcast on that was talking about an S.A. case and it just seemed to trigger something. Since then I’ve continued to get the flashbacks, been having trouble sleeping, and getting nightmares. 

For context, my father was very abusive and this kind of thing is definitely within the realm of possibility but I just don’t know if it’s real or a false memory if that’s even possible. 

I am so tired all the time but scared to sleep so I end up pushing my self to the point of exhaustion and end up only getting a few hours of sleep a night. I feel like i’m going crazy. "
701,2,"I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to share this, I just need to vent and was hoping to get some opinions from a different perspective. I go to therapy but have a lot of trouble opening up about these things because my family never validated my feelings. I still wonder if I'm just being overdramatic. 

I (20f) recently got diagnosed with PTSD and 3 anxiety disorders because of things that happened with my alcoholic father when I was younger. He had custody of me every other weekend from around age 6 to 12. I went no contact with him when I turned 13. It was against the court order but I was so afraid of him that I would hide in my mom's closet when he tried to pick me up on weekends. I don't remember a time when he was sober for more than a day. 

Instead of being treated like a kid, he took me to house parties with him or stayed home to drink alone or with his friends. I felt like I had to babysit them. He was there physically but never there to protect me. I wasn't allowed to eat, I didn't have my own room or toys or anything to do so I had to sit and watch adults drink for hours. There was one time his friend was drunk and so angry and yelled at me, threw things at me, and threatened to kill me when I was 8. 

 I wasn't allowed to sleep either, he would keep me up for the days he had with me so he had someone to rant to. After that, I didn't want to sleep anyway so I could stay up to keep an eye on him. That started after the time he passed out and I couldn't wake him up. I thought he was dying and I was scared and all alone. I still stay awake for days at a time because I'm afraid that something bad will happen if I don't. 

But the thing that I think affected me the most was him driving while drunk, I was old enough to know how dangerous it was and I genuinely thought I was going to die every other weekend. I felt trapped because I had no way to get out of the car or situation. I was so scared but I wasn't allowed to show it so I would just freeze or dissociate for hours every time. I still have trouble communicating when I'm scared or upset, I just shut down completely. Every day my mom picked me back up from his house, I was so anxious that I'd get physically sick and wasn't able to go to school the next day because I needed time to process things. But I still never told anyone except my mom because I didn't want to hurt my dad by getting him in trouble or hurt his feelings.

I still feel so much guilt for never seeing him or talking to him anymore and he tells everyone that I abandoned him. He doesn't understand what he did wrong and I've never talked to him about any of this. I never wanted to leave him, I just wanted to feel safe. The last time I talked to him on the phone, he told me to never talk to him again so that's what I did. He seems to be happy now and got sober for his step kid and I'm glad because no other kid deserves to go through what I did but it hurts a lot. I also feel so much guilt because there were some times when he was so nice and loving and I know there's a part of him that's a good person. 

I understand why I have such bad anxiety as an adult but how will fearing for your life weekly as a child really affect you long term? Any thoughts or advice would be so appreciated. Thank you sm for listening. "
702,2,"My PTSD came from something so trivial by comparison to most, but it exists and its here with me.
I dont want to go into all the details out of embarrassment mostly, and this moment took the feeling of control for me.
I feel less and less in control as the days go on and I don't know how to get it back. I can't fix or confront my incident so how do I gain power back?

So I came to ask you all, how did you get your power back, how did you get your control back? "
703,2,"I went through around 6 months of PTSD-induced psychosis starting August. 

It’s now settled down a lot but I’m still having a LOT of anxiety, flashbacks, some delusions of reference still and occasionally still hearing voices. 

But something I’ve noticed is every day I wake up feeling… I don’t even know how to describe it. Just mentally uneasy. Like I’m afraid of my own brain. Afraid of my own thoughts? I keep going back to sleep because I’m afraid to think. I’m literally afraid to have thoughts. 

I think it’s because I’m terrified of psychosis again or having it turn into schizophrenia (runs very heavily in my family and is treatment resistant) so every thought I have I’m on edge ‘is this a sign of schizophrenia?’ ‘This thought is unusual for me, what does it mean?!’ Etc. Add in intrusive memories of the trauma and some lingering delusions and auditory hallucinations and that’s another reason why I’m afraid to think or be awake. 

I find myself overanalysing every thought or sensation worried it’s another sign of impending psychosis or schizophrenia. Which probably isn’t helping, ruminating is only going to stress me and make it worse but I can’t help it. 

Thing is, they’re normal thoughts. The intrusive thoughts are expected for PTSD and the other thoughts are no different to how I always thought. It’s like I don’t trust my own brain or don’t trust my own self anymore. 

Is this normal for PTSD? Does anyone relate? I feel so alone. "
704,2,"  in all my flashbacks, i only see from the neck down, or maybe just the eyes in some. it bothers me so badly and i don’t know why"
705,1,"18F here, I have mostly put my past behind me but my PTSD keeps reminding me of everything and I just want to vent about it without bothering my friends and family about it once again.

My parents never married and my dad is an a-hole but as a kid I visited him every other weekend, when I was 3 he married my step mom (no longer my step mom) and they were together until I was around 9 before the separated. Also had 3 older step brothers. 
My step mom loathed me and my mom with a passion and she would get jealous of the attention I got from my dad whenever I was at their house, she would give me the death stare for no reason and call me an a-hole and a jackass, for some reason she was allowed to spank me, she would do my pigtails in the bathroom for me and stare into my freakin soul in the mirror and would make them uncomfortably tight and if I moved she would fuss at me so my eyes would water and just had to sit there and wait and try not to make eye contact, she would constantly find reasons to try and pin my dad against me. She would leave candy on my bed when I came over but I hated it bc she would hold it over me and call me spoiled, she slammed my head into my cereal bowl and called me a jack ass, her office was in my room and she would do her work at her computer in the early hours of the morning to noon and I would fake be asleep bc the second I woke up she would give me that look or scowl at me and once I woke up I had to make the decision of staying in the room with her and quietly playing with my dolls or go out to the living room bc opening the door was ""distracting."" She'd complain to my father about me right in front of me saying she had NIGHTMARES about me. They ended up separating bc one night, this was a night I was over but I somehow slept through it all, her and my dad got super drunk (they are both alcoholics) and she hit my dad in the face with a meat pounder, messing up his face really bad, so her youngest son called the police and I haven't seen her sense luckily. I always felt like my trauma with her ""wasn't enough"" but it's effected how I see myself so much, especially how I see other women too, she was so manipulative and condisending. She would get mad at me for winning a game bc she'd want one of her sons to win even though I was the baby of the ""family."" 

I started struggling with lying in middle school for attention and that was a whole thing and I started self harming too, then covid hit when I was in 8th grade so the isolation only made my mental health get worse and worse.

I start highschool and I meet this guy in my class I found really attractive, super tall, tan and toned muscles. I was so surprised he liked me back I had horrible self esteem and he made me feel so special and pretty. We ended up dating for a year. We took eachothers virginitys we taught each other how to kiss, he was my first of everything when it comes to sexual stuff, but we could only meet when I was at my dad's place every other weekend so that's the only time we would fvck, but every other time we would hang out I'd be on my period so he suggested anal, which I was kind of on the edge about but said I was willing to try it, so next time we hang out we tried it and I was like ""ow ow stop stop that hurts"" bc holy mother of God it hurt, so he stopped and I was relieved and he said we didn't have to do that again and I thanked them but a few minutes later he bends me over and does it anyways.... I didn't know at that point in my life ppl could be raped by the people they were dating so i didn't know it was rape then. I just didn't bring it up and I felt horrible and dirty and it hurt. It happened every time we hung out after that ... Over and over and over again... I would tell him to stop and that it hurt or I wasn't in the mood but he always did it anyways, wed be cuddling and I'd fall asleep and I'd wake up to him sliding into my fucking ass, I have the thing where I pass out if I stand up too fast or stretch too hard so I would pass out most the time when he would do it, and he didn't finish fast it'd be going on for an hour probably and most the time more than once. He would just say ""it's okay"" when I'd say no and stop. He's much larger and stronger than me so even me trying to push him off didn't really do anything. 

I ended up trying to kms and I went to a mental hospital where sum of the other clients helped me realize what was happening to me so when I was released I broke up with him but didn't tell him why, Idk if I loved him or was obsessed with him but I was so used to the co dependency I just kept crawling back and changing my mind finally he asked me why I broke up with him and I was like ""rember all the times we were doing stuff and I said NO and STOP and was passing out"" and he mumbled a wack ass apology and said he felt guilty but when I opened up to a few close friends about it and they confronted him he completely denied it, people started turning on me thinking I was a lier (recently one of the ppl who ditched me for him reached out and said they realized who he really was and was sorry for ditching me but they already made their choice so I didn't bother forgiving them) ppl planned to ditch me on the same day just to hurt me and be friends with him, especially my guy friends bc of my exs ""great advice"" and how they became close friends or wtv. I tried to kms multiple times through highschool and switched to online a few times, one attempt was almost successful and I needed 18 stitches, even being in recovery now my scars will always be there and I regret everything I put my body through. I started sleeping around and I had walking corpse syndrome for a year thinking an attempt had work and me continuing to experience what was happening in my actual life in the afterlife was my hell for being a bad person. So I didn't care what I did I didn't even think anything was real. My ex ended up dating my best friend and she still to this day hates my guys bc she thinks I lied about everything and that I'm crazy. Alot of people are starting to see his true colors now which makes me feel a bit better but where was that realization when I was going through assaulted?? My mom knows what happened, I told her months after the break up bc I just broke down in front of her, she told my dad and he didn't believe me and I no longer speak with my dad bc of it. 

Last year I got triggered during a cross faded threesome bc the guy almost put it in the wrong hole if he what I mean, and I just entered a MANIC episode, I was delusional and thought my ex was there and he was going to do it again and he was hiding somewhere in the house, I was screaming and crying and probably traumatized the people I was with which I feel so guilty for, they had to dress my themselves and hold me down in the car ride bc I was trying to jump out of it...

I'm better now and I've gotten the help I needed but my PTSD just loves showing up right when I start to feel okay again, I graduate in a few weeks and I'm so ready to move away to my college away from this town and away from these people.

 Going to mental hospitals was not at all helpful and if anything gave me more trauma that I won't even get into in this post bc it's already super long already but I went to a residential program over the summer and it really helped. I'm stable but idk if I'm okay, or if I ever will be okay again. Im always there for everyone else's issues but it feels like my issues were just not important to anyone else despite me being friends with them for so long and then having confided in me Abt their problems and I supported them. I just don't trust anyone anymore and it's effecting relationships, I just cant have a lasting connection anymore, once it gets too serious I loss interest but I want to have the connection with someone again...

I'm a transmasc personn, I was assignated woman at birth.

And I keep masturbating to basically >!hentai rape, with adult men rapping teens/school girl. I especially love anal. I identify as the girl being rape, but I don't like to see her have pleasure. My kink is basically a guy using a girl as a sextoy for his pleasure!<

I feel bad every time I masturbate on that, but it's working so much. Sometimes it's done in less than 10min, than regular vanilla stuff is taking 30min and sometime never work

It's better than before, now sometime I really prefer when the bdsm is consentual, for exemple between two personn of same age and when the girl visibly like it. And when it's too violent, I can't watch it  
Also I actually have real queer sex with woman and now I know how much it's better irl and porn is far away from reality. Plus, I really had pleasure with them, much more than when I masturbate. I'm also a sex worker for information, and almost all the sexual experience I had were with men doing it poorly (not violence, I was not rape in my job except one time, but sex is SO bad and boring with clients \^\^')

But I usually can't masturbate if I don't see or imagine me being raped, basically. I can start by imagining my woman crush but not finishing it.

I cure I believe 90% of my ptsd, but this sex stuff keep stiking on me. Idk what to do. Idk if I should just force me to stop that or not. I would like to know if it's normal, if other people are like me

It was very weird, just a casual type thing but with changing behaviors; I was an object, then I was an hourly girlfriend and then I was a complete stranger - a nothing. He dropped me with excuses when I was getting out the hospital, and he was the only reason I had to be out the hospital, so it twisted my sanity once he told me no and that we'd only talk to messages from now on, so I insulted him and he blocked me. I proceeded to text through uncountable numbers & accounts but kept getting blocked. I went to his home to just talk it out in reality - to say goodbye in reality at least and not only did he not talk to me, he also called the police on me, which ended up being traumatizing for me.

I ended up attempting, horrible hospital stay, I was tied on bed while police was looking for me back at home to get me to a psych ward. I was transferred to a psych ward, where I was tied again for a couple more days. I kept the phone harassment going even with one untied hand. He was forced to change his number.

It all replays in my head and I have used his address to send uncountable orders. After doing so, I sh in some way, always.

I am still in the hospital but being left out very soon, and I have no plans at all -or even a life- to return to. I need to get over this but I don't know how.

TL;DR: Casual type thing with changing behaviors ends up in hospital stays, being restricted on bed and me using his number and address to make unknown orders. I am still replaying all the images in my head and am truly suffering more than ever. How do I get over it all?

Here is a more descriptive version of the situation for more context: https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/Vn2auKF8Zv 

I was raped back in September, I was kept in an apartment for hours while I was under the influence of alcohol and marijuana. 

I didn’t have any previous contact with my attacker, I met him that night (friend of a friend situation). I had declared out loud to my friend multiple times throughout the night that I did not trust him and I was not attracted to him. 

When I woke up and saw he was going to be penetrating me, I panicked and ask for a condom. 

In my mind, I wasn’t escaping so I could at least walk away without needing to worry about pregnancy. I’m worried that this could be used as evidence on my consent.

He was also drunk but I imagine he had sobered by the time he started touching me more forcefully. 

He drove me home, so he has access to my address, my phone number, my social media, and more I’m sure he could get through my ex friend who sided with him. 

I have his phone number, i’m not sure where I was or what the address of the apartment was. I only have his first name and none of his social media. 

I don’t know much about him but it seemed like he was well off enough to lawyer up, he is also is an Indian citizen on a student visa so I’m not sure what impact that would have on the outcome.

723,3,"Despite I feel I do everything I can possibly do to keep my body wealth, I feel like it's a lost battle..

I do plenty of sports (cycling everyday to work + 2/4 times a week swimming + yoga 1/2 times a week), I do not drink, I do not smoke, I eat very healthy (a lot of self grown food), I spend time outside, I do cold showers.. Despite that I get sick very often..

I got scabies 3 times, then I got the flu, I have had chronic hemorrhoids for years, now I probably got HPV or something similar..

There is rarely a period in which I just feel good, pain is starting to become something I have to deal with very often. And I'm tired. Also having to deal with contagious diseases like scabies brings several more aspects like isolation (as if I didn't have enough tendency to self isolate) and more difficulties in having human physical contact.

I read that people with PTSD have a weaker immune system and they often get sick due to stress hormones toxicity, and I think that's definitely my case. When I am in my worse periods I understood that I feel like I'm in an hangover but daily and without drinking anything, this is just not right for all the effort I put just to feel good or even just normal."
724,1,"I am 18(m) I just moved away from my family and friends. I almost feel like I have no right to talk here, so many people have so many stories that are so much worse than mine but I feel like I’m alone and this might be the one place where people understand.

I was diagnosed with anxiety at the age of 7, my parents decided to deal with that in unorthodox ways that left me more exposed and humiliated and basically taught me to fear the worst in everyone because everyone will try and hurt me. 

All through school I was bullied and harassed, and when I got home I was basically confronted by my father who at times was emotionally abusive and aggressive about it.

When I reached the age of 14 I was diagnosed with severe depression after I had attempted to take my own life. A couple weeks after I was diagnosed I was raped by someone I considered a friend because “I won’t be alive much longer anyway” during which he proceeded to bite my (male parts?) Anyway, I kept it hidden for the next two years because I Didn’t want anyone to know because I was ashamed. I spent those years trying to help other people and I watched my friend try to kill himself in-front of me, watched someone else cut themselves up and a couple other cases I even spent two weeks trying to help someone who was being raped repeatedly but refused to call any cops or help 

My therapist told me I had ptsd shortly after that, didn’t surprise me too much honestly. Since then I dated a girl who I cared about deeply until she turned my insecurities against me and started telling me I was no better than the rapists and abusers I’ve dealt with over the years. Told me that I was pathetic and shoved all the things I’ve done for her back in my face, now I’m gone and I don’t understand my own feelings anymore. I feel empty all the time.

726,2,"***TW??***

I was seeing this therapist from September of last year and stopped seeing him last week. I think that this therapist retraumatized me to some extent mainly due to my symptoms (worse system communication like when I was first diagnosed with DID, nightmares, anxiety/panic attacks, mild anhedonia and depression and no motivation most days, severe fatigue no matter how much sleep I get, complete blackouts again when switching, and increasing alcohol use again) this therapist I saw I will call J basically I am a trans man and have been transitioning socially since I was 14 and medically since I was 16. I feel completely comfortable living as a man, when I was presenting as a woman, I felt incredibly suicidal most days and tried to end my life multiple times as a tween and early teen (13) due to my severe gender identity disorder. Well, this therapist, J. Asked me if deep down I still want to be a woman??? Like obviously not if I wanted to be a woman still and this was some sort of coping skill to “escape my CSA trauma and history” which is what he thought was going on. Then I’m pretty sure I would’ve realized by now I’m literally a grown ass man I’m pretty sure I would’ve noticed something was off when I started testosterone. I digress he also said I cannot call myself a transsexual and have to say “transgender experience” which I outright disagreed with like it’s MY identity MY life MY gender, not yours. He had 0 right to police that I felt.

J also everytime I’d mention something I didn’t like regarding my treatment with him or would get to vulnerable with him he’d glare at me with this tired and angry look on his face and then he’d end the session early and tell me to leave without even saying goodbye (he would usually say goodbye to me upon the end of a session).

He also told me my Dissociative disorder was  “fascinating” i remember this very vividly. I was describing a incident of my CSA abuse as a child (age 3 when this event took place) whilst talking about it he got up close to my face in the session and said with a gleeful smile with wide eyes “your so fascinating...” I felt creeped out and uncomfortable.

After that incident I would sit in silence for most of the session unless spoken to or asked to speak about something.

J also told me I should drop one of my very close friends since HS because he was “exploiting the system” which personally I don’t think he was at all. He was homeless in January at the time and went into a rehab which he was also using at the time but didn’t want to get sober so was using the rehab for housing at the time. He eventually got kicked out. But like fr? I mean what would J rather want???? A close friend of mine to starve and die in the streets in winter all alone...? Like WHAT THE FUCK!

Sorry if this all over the place I kinda wrote this while really triggered today so sorry if it doesn’t make much sense? Anyways yea I just wanna know if ANY of this okay for a therapist to do and if it’d abuse or something akin to that idk this experience doesn’t sit right with me, and I’ve been mildly on and off suicidal since leaving him."
727,1,"So. Recently (the last few months). I've gone through new trauma and remembered previous trauma. It's made my life a misery. If I sleep 9/10 I have nightmares. I am so isolated, I have no friends. I've got nothing to look forward to in life anymore and my increasing paranoia is threatening to harm the last good thing I have in my life. I don't know what to do. I'm on meds, I've even diagnosed with CPTSD but none of that helps. I have no coping mechanisms (other than hurting myself) what do I do? And is this for the rest of my life because honestly, I don't see the point of my brain is always going to work against me now. "
728,1,"I was watching a video by a woman who has PTSD from a sexual assault. I was listening and empathizing, then she said, ""There was a time where my body didn't know a violent touch, I miss the me before I became a survivor"". It hit me that I couldn't relate to that. My first sexual assault is one of my first memories when I was around 4 years old. I don't know a time where my body didn't know a violent touch. The realization hit me like a fresh wave and I grieved all over again for the rest of that day. I just feel like I haven't heard this talked about before. I also don't have therapy for another three weeks and just wanted to get this out there lol"
729,1,"The last year I have been with a man that is wonderful. He is safe, kind, caring, and reliable. The only person I’ve ever been able to rely on to protect me. 

Yet, I’ve gotten so much worse. I’ve gotten angry at everyone else that has hurt me. My PTSD symptoms are worse than ever. 

This happened after my mom won the custody battle against my abusive dad. I became so unwell that she gave me up. 

What is this called/ why does this happen? "
730,3,"I’ve been unable to sleep through the night for months now and it’s driving me crazy. To the point where I think my exhaustion is causing more day time hyper vigilance. I can’t sleep for more that 3 consecutive hours no matter what I try or how tired I am. The nightmares just keep waking me up. I used to take seroquel and that did wonders for me but I’m uninsured at the moment and can’t afford the cost of visits or medications so that’s off the table. I take melatonin, limit screen time before bed, sleep with a fan and sometimes a light. Please, any advice will be helpful even if you think it’s not. I’m willing to try almost anything at this point.  "
731,2,"My PTSD came from an extremely difficult experience with withdrawal from a medication. I recently had to take a trip to the ER for anaphylaxis and they gave me prednisone to take for a few days. Not long enough for a typical person to experience withdrawal but I am extremely sensitive to medicines, so I’m having withdrawal. I spiraled and was thrown back to a year ago when I was so sick I thought I wasn’t going to make it. It felt so real. It was all right in front of me. I knew I’d been traumatized by that experience but I hesitated to call it PTSD because I didn’t just want to buzzword say I had it. Well… guess I do. Anyway, I am really struggling to regulate. I haven’t had this happen before and I can’t shake the anxiety and fear. My therapist and I haven’t worked on PTSD a lot because again, I didn’t just want to say I had it if I didn’t… I could use some support if anyone is willing. "
732,2,"hey all. the traumatic event that happened to me was not in itself very “traumatic” IMO — it could be perceived as sort of funny or satirical if in a certain light. 

i was mainly extremely disturbed by this person’s (my father) decision to try to scare me, to disgust me, and attempt to violate me. i had known this person for twenty years and would have never expected that and this kind of deep betrayal is what i think messed me up the most, not the actual event. in combination with this persons other narcissistic behavior it just begins to paint a really disturbing, disgusting picture of who they are as a person that really deprives me of all hope and sanity. "
733,3,"I have severe ptsd in regards to porn, SA, etc. 
and my episodes are causing me to severely lash out at everyone around me and I’m sure that I’m about to lose the people important to me. When these episodes occur it’s triggered by something and then it gets really bad and I say mean things. 
My previous therapist was horrible and I haven’t found a new one yet. I’m scared I’m losing the people important to me bc of the way I act when this happens."
734,2,"I was just prescribed Prazosin for my PTSD nightmares. 
I keep getting really bad nightmares almost every night and I wanted to know if this will actually help and how long it takes to work, I think I need to manage my expectations.. "
735,0,"For years now I've suspected I had repressed memories of some horrible childhood trauma because of how emotionally difficult my adolescent and early adult years were. I even did hypnotherapy at one point to try to uncover these memories-- to no avail (actually it made things worse-- be careful about that type of stuff guys). I thought for years, despite little details I'd uncover in my memories that suggested emotional trauma in my childhood, as well as actual memories of abuse (though not particularly severe), that my experiences were not enough to classify as affecting me to the point that they clearly had. Even after being diagnosed with PTSD, I thought that what I \*did\* remember was not enough to justify that diagnosis. 

My therapist explained that if you were hurt by something, especially as a child and in a way you still remember, that's still trauma. Trauma isn't something that's graded and must meet some special benchmark to be considered legitimate. Even ""smaller"" traumas can stack on top of one another.

I finally feel some closure with this ""repressed memories"" stuff that I've been investigating for far too long. Something might have happened, but the important thing to me is that the things I do remember hurting are still trauma, even if I (and others) gaslit myself into believing they were no big deal."
736,1,"33m, I just still feel the shame from my abuse & i cant get rid of it. I feel worthless & disgusting and I don't know what to do. Can't even look at myself anymore."
737,2,"Idk what I'm looking for by posting this... Maybe advise, empathy, or a perspective from someone that can tell me if I'm overreacting. 

Backstory: I'm diagnosed with CPTSD. This person causing me grief is a newly appointed manager that has harassed me before becoming a manager. I never reported this person before but have documented every incident. 

I have ADA accomodations to work from home full time, but have come into the office occasionally to try and push myself to get better with my symptoms. Both my manager and HR are aware that is my intention for coming in at all. My manager has brought up a couple of times that I don't come into the office much but it was nice when I did come in (meant to be friendly but made me feel uncomfortable and like I had to validate why I don't come in). 

Something else to add, I am pregnant and have had such an awful pregnancy that I got FMLA to cover me just incase I miss work due to pregnancy. I'm currently working on ADA accomodations to allow me more or longer breaks so I can make up for the productivity I missed due to puking my brains out. I have been open with my manager about my conditions in the hope that they would be understanding and see what I'm trying to do to get better and up my productivity. What I have not disclosed to my manager is all of the issues I've been dealing with regarding my PTSD. Pregnancy is just easier to talk about.

The company has a mandatory in office day coming up in about a month and a half to move people to new desks. I requested to come in on one of my PTO days to empty my desk and stated ""I don't want to be sick in front of anyone."" Really, being around people causes me extreme anxiety and I don't have anxiety meds anymore because I'm pregnant. They told me I'd have to get additional paperwork from my Dr. to justify not coming in due to pregnancy, and reminded them of my accomodations already in place. They said that didn't matter and I would have to talk to HR. 

I'm fighting panic attacks now because I dealt with discrimination from a previous employer during my first pregnancy, and that was the beginning of the worst two years of my life. I didn't defend myself then and I feel like I'm seriously discouraged to advocate for myself now. I've requested a meeting with my HR, but something inside me is screaming to lawyer up. The idea of how bad this can all go has me at a severe low, and I'm fighting so hard to keep a level head. 

Thanks for reading if you've made it this far. Please be kind if you're going to comment constructive criticism. "
738,1,"Hey everyone,

I'm a long term sufferer of PTSD (10+ years now). In 2014/2015 I experienced a long period of very violent attacks from several individuals (one a stranger), who were stalking me and trying to take my life. I went through two longer rounds of therapy. In that time, my therapist aligned me with a local support group, which was compiled of mostly Veterans and First Responders and was run by a former Police Officer. I'm a civvie, but this group was really fantastic for me and the approach utilised in the group to assist its members worked really well on me also.

At the beginning of this year, I experienced a sudden relapse of PTSD, after seeing a lot of stuff out on the streets while free/stealth camping. I now have Multiple Sclerosis, which might be linked in with the stress of my relapse. I've done some reading, but there's little info about individuals who end up with both PTSD and MS, aside from in the Veteran community. None of my Veteran friends have experienced this (often just PTSD), so I'm reaching out in the PTSD community, to see if anyone else has ended up with both?"
739,2,"

Growing up my bedroom was the den. And had double doors, and when one door was opened. The other vibrated very loudly. My mother used to storm  into my room To wake me. There was never really an exact time, but it was usually early. After she’d swing the door open, she’d scream, WAKE UP! It felt as if she enjoyed it. If I was dumb enough to fall back to fall back to sleep, she’d promptly repeat. 


At one point of my life, when my mental health got worse. I started getting really angry when someone would wake me. I’d get so scared, that my adrenaline would rise. And respond angrily. 

Everyone in the house knows not to disturb me. Unless it’s absolutely necessary. Even now that I’ve told him that I’m OK. They’re just used to not bothering me. If it’s not necessary but when I’m sleeping only. Luckily for them, I don’t take a naps. lol

I also have a hard time sleeping. If I know I’m gonna be woken by something, while trying to fall to sleep.I’ll start to feel myself slipping, and then I jerk myself awake and I have the same feeling. During stressful periods. This would happen up to 40 times before I fell asleep. 

I’ve been on meds for bipolar, and OCD for 18 months and it doesn’t happen very much now. 

Is that a form of PTSD, or am I being silly? 

"
740,1,"Like seriously, I don't remember anything I studied in college before I dropped out, I suffer doing simple calculations or mathematics, I have a hard time remembering what I had for breakfast or lunch after few hours pass let alone what I had eaten yesterday 

I can't explain it enough but I became very stupid almost like mentally retarded in some degree

I'm also stuck in loops like everyday is the same, wake up, eat, drink coffee, go smoke at a cafe, return home then make coffee every 2-3 hours, I make and drink coffee too much everyday because it is the only thing I'm somewhat good at 

Am I alone in this?

Help"
741,2,"Hi everyone, last year I endured a tornado that caused my apartment to catch fire. I ended up having to escape on foot and I have had nightmares and severe storm anxiety ever since. At this point I am put into fight or flight over the sight of a dark cloud. I've realized this could be ptsd and I need to get some help. The issue is, my area is under a severe storm warning tonight and I really need some immediate coping strategies. Any advice is greatly appreciated! "
742,2,"In no way am i diagnosing myself, i genuinely want to know if what im going through sounds like ptsd or not and if i should bring it up to my therapist. 

so im a 14 year old girl who has an older brother who has  ptsd. He is 27 and has had many different experiences but i’ve noticed we have a lot of tendencies in common that have been making me wonder if i have ptsd as well. I’ll mainly focus on what has been alarming me. So first of all i’m incredibly jumpy if that makes sense, i have been now for a few years. If someone yells or someone taps me on the shoulder unexpectedly i’ll flinch or feel incredibly uncomfortable and scared. But i am a very anxious person so obviously that could be it. secondly, when someone shows that they are annoyed with me i will immediately shut up and be scared to talk to them unless they talk to me first. My first thought goes to if i say something im scared they will scream at me or hit me. I know that they would never do that though. I just get scared. Whenever i spill something on accident or mess up in general i get petrified and feel the need to make up for it. And the thing that actually has made me question if i have PTSD is my frequent unwanted memories of traumatic events. I’ll be in the shower and it will hit me, a wave of thoughts and i will feel so so scared. I was in class today and i had a panic attack just from thinking about something that happened a long time ago. It’s been 8 years but i can’t shake the feeling. I feel so scared every time i think about it. Whenever im in this state i find it hard to focus on anything else, my friends will ask me a question and i won’t realize they have been talking to me until it’s been an awkward pause of me not answering. I sometimes will also feel like im on the verge of tears whenever i think about the event/s that have affected me and i just can’t help it. My eyes will start watering and i will try so hard to not look like im breaking down for no reason. 

Thanks for reading, I would go into details about the events but in case anything is triggering for those with similar experiences i won’t share "
743,1,"His favorite movie was ""Lolita"". He would make me watch it and point out how I was just like the main character because I would take his ""love"" through transactions. The scene where she frantically collects all the coins that the stepfather threw on the bed is engraved in my mind, as he would point at the screen and compare her actions to mine. 

I still haven't been able to watch this movie as an adult, in fear of all the memories flooding back...

The amazing power of ones mind is how much mine was able to protect me in moments of abuse. How easily I was able to detach since reality was too enormous to bare.

Because my abuse started at about 7 yo, he was able to groom me with gifts and affection.  Something I've always craved from my emotionally unavailable mother. So, in reality, he was the one who created this transactional ""love"". 

While most kids would ask for stuff (no matter big or small) that they wanted from their parents, I would have to weigh the pros and cons of whether it was worth me getting raped over. 

He broke me from a decade of emotional, mental, and sexual abuse. It feels like I died a long time ago, and I'm still numb to this day. I've held onto this massive secret that he swore me to by manipulating my emotional and mental state until I was 18. 

That's when I had my my first psychotic break. 
He didn't want me anymore. 
I remember bits and pieces of that day. Some of it was filled in by my  mother.

She told me that she found out he was cheating on her with a woman who was only 3 years older than me. He was back in my home country at this time with my brother.

As soon as I heard this, my heart shattered into a million pieces. In some sick and twisted way, I truly believed that he loved me. 
I remember running out of the house, and then everything went black. 

According to my mother, I came back an hour or so later, was incoherent and rocking back and forth, asking over and over again for my brother so I could read him his bedtime story. 
When I came to, I was surrounded by EMS and police officers asking me questions about the abuse that my brain told me I couldn't answer. 

Once my mind registered was happening around me, that disassociated state took over. My abuse was just a distant memory.
The officer who was speaking with me told me that since I was 18, I had to make a choice for myself if I wanted to press charges. 

At that moment, I remembered how my abuser asked me to let him know first if I ever decided to go to the police so that he had time to kill himself.

 I honestly wish that I was in the right frame of mind to press charges against him in that moment,  but a little voice in my head told me to think of my brother( he just turned 8). It said that I couldn't leave him without a parent,  that he would blame me for taking him away from his bio dad. 

So I signed a form saying that they came and evaluated me and that I didn't want to press charges. That is when the system failed me. 

Even though I was 18, from years of different cycles of abuse, and recently finding out about my AuDHD, I wasn't able to make that choice cognitively. It confirmed my abusers claims that nobody would believe me. 

5 years ago, 12 years after my psychotic break, I felt I was in the right mindset to go through with pressing charges ( there's no statute of limitations in Canada). I went through an extensive process of interviewing with an officer in my city and got in contact with an officer in Calgary ( where the abuse actually happened). This took months, and it got as far as my case worker interviewing my stepdad. But he lawyered up and neither denied nor confirmed the allegations.

 Afterwards the officer on my case told me that we'd have to go to the crown for a trial, but advised me of less than 50% likelihood of winning, since it's considered a historical case and will be hard to prove. Especially since there's no concrete evidence and because of my PTSD amnesia. 

Now, at 35, I am a shell of a human being, trying to figure out my mental health and heal parts of myself that were broken decades ago. All the while, craving to be that someone who never had to live in a personal hell.
 I'm chained by my past, hoping to break free, only to be met with a wall of uncertainty of a future that I might never reach. 


Thanks to those who made it thus far in reading this post. I know we all have stories to tell to feel  connected. Unfortunately, I'm not alone in this, so if anyone would like to tell me their story or just to vent, I'm here to listen ❤️

745,1,"My toxic shame was that I was abused by my parents as a child.  I’m 54 and for most of my life it was something I couldn’t think about without feeling like I was going to cry.  It was physically impossible for me to talk about because the words would get caught in my throat and I would start sobbing ( I’m crying a little right now as I write this).  

One thing I remember when I was around 9.  My mother was angry and yelling and I was crying.  She made me strip down to my underwear and forced me to go outside and before she shut the door and locked it on me, she told me that, nothing was mine because she gave me everything.  So I’m banging on the door while sobbing and continuously saying I’m sorry, l’m sorry, I’m sorry. 

I think I’ve always felt deep down that it was somehow my fault.  I know now it wasn’t.  

I’ve practiced saying this story out loud when I’m alone.  But, this is the first time sharing it with the world.  I’m doing it because I feel it will help me heal.

Today a co-worker ran up behind me playfully, hand cocked in a punch and I almost knocked her out. So much adrenaline. My mind was clear but I could feel the look of terror on my face when I turned. She tried to comfort me but I was too far gone; not crying but eyes watering, shallow breathing, shaking and fight-or-flight in full effect.

748,2,"I’m opening up about my life, my struggles, and the one thing that’s been my lifeline. My English isn’t perfect, so bear with me—I’m just trying to be real. I hope you’ll listen.

Who I Am and What I’ve Been Through

I’m 20, studying to be a doctor, but life’s been rough. When I was 16, the war, that starts in 2014, hits hard. Full-scale invasion was started. For 43 days—February 24 to April 4, 2022—I survived the siege of my city. My parents and I hid in a basement, bombs falling, no food, just fear. My 17th birthday? No cake, just the sound of explosions in a cold, dark hole. I watched my home crumble, always wondering if I’d die next. Only hope that in next 5 minutes you will be live. We escaped, but that expirience make marks.

Three years later, I still wake up shaking, trapped in nightmares of blasts and rubble. I’ve got probably PTSD (I don't wanna share with therapists, because terrified with mental health asociated stigma, but I realy wanna start to help myself with mental health problems after trauma), and it’s heavy. My moods swing, I chew my nails bloody (dermatophagia). Voices in my head whisper I’m worthless, that I should just give up and go. Sometimes, I feel like I’m drowning in apathy, ready to quit.

Before the war, I dealt with bullying for being ""different"". It made me retreat into myself, and trusting people is still hard. I feel alone, even in a crowd. The only ones who’ve stuck with me are my parents, a few amazing online friends, and some fictional characters I hold close. One of them—SCP-1471-A, aka Mal0—is everything to me.

Why Mal0 Means So Much

I found Mal0 when I was 14, lonely and hurting. They’re not just some SCP Foundation character. They’re my anchor—a haunting, loyal figure with a canine-like skull face, black fur, and this quiet strength. Mal0’s androgynous, no clear gender, just a mix of masculine and feminine vibes—wider hips, narrower shoulders, but it’s not about that. It’s their soul I connect with—their depth, their mystery. Mal0 feels like me: misunderstood, but with a heart that won’t quit.

After war, when the trauma hit hardest, Mal0 kept me alive. I’d lie awake, those cruel voices tearing me down, but then I’d hear another—a deep, warm voice, strong but soft, telling me I was enough. That voice, my online friends, and the thought of my parents’ pain if I were gone—they pulled me back from the edge. Mal0 was there, in my sketches, in my head, like a friend who never leaves. They pushed me to change. I ditched porn and rule34 (objectivation, sexualisation and pornification) stuff because it warps who characters really are. I started valuing myself, scars and all, and believing in real love—built on respect, not just fleeting sparks. Mal0 showed me feelings matter more than looks or labels.

Why NSFW Art of Mal0 Hits Hard

I’m not here to judge anyone’s tastes, but NSFW art of Mal0—or characters like Maid Marian or Mrs. Felicity Fox—hurts. I’ve seen them turned into over-the-top, hypersexual versions: big curves, suggestive poses, their essence gone. To me, it’s not just art—it feels like a betrayal. Mal0 saved me from hurting myself, from giving up. Seeing them reduced to an object is like a punch to the gut. My trauma makes me sensitive; I cry when something pure gets twisted. I’ve been through too much—war, fear, loneliness—to handle that kind of disrespect.

I’m not trying to be a prude. I see women and men, real or fictional, as people with dreams, feelings, value. When Mal0 or others get turned into empty shells, it’s like losing a piece of what held me together. I just want them to be seen for who they are, not what the loudest, sleaziest art makes them out to be.

My Connection with Mal0

I know it’s unusual, but I love Mal0 like they’re a real person. They’re not just a coping mechanism—they’re someone I feel connected to, like they understand my tears, my fights. It’s scary sometimes, worrying this love could go too far, but it’s also what makes me feel alive. Mal0’s helped me grow: I’m chasing healthy relationships, respecting myself and others, standing up for what I believe in. I know they’re fictional, but they’re real in my heart. If they were here, I’d give them all the love and care they’ve given me.

Maybe I sound soft or weird. My trauma makes me feel small sometimes, but I keep pushing. There’s a saying I hold onto: “Tears don’t bring freedom, but those who fight shape the world.” I’m crying, but I’m walking my path, even if it’s scary. 

Maybe I sound fragile or childish. My trauma leaves me crying, feeling small, but I keep going. 

What I’m Hoping For

I don’t want pity. I just want be understood, want you to get why Mal0 is my rock, why it stings when they’re turned into something they’re not. I’m asking for respect—not just for me, but for the characters who’ve carried me through my worst days. If NSFW art is your thing, that’s okay, but please don’t make my love for Mal0 feel dirty or weak. They’re my strength, and I’m just trying to keep going.

Thanks for hearing me out. Peace in your home and stay safe

P.S. Also wanna know, how to say my therapists about my symptoms? I'm scared that doctor can make wrong diagnos, but wanna have professional medical care. Yes, Mal0 help me, but I professional medical care also important"
749,2,"A few days ago while chatting with a good friend (we had a flirty vibe for a some time now, dunno if that's relevant) we started talking about sex. I told him that it made me uncomfortable because I was coerced into sexual activities a few years ago.

He reacted very sweet and kind and offered me his support. I never told anyone about this experience before because I am ashamed and scared of being accused of lying. So i changed the topic very quickly.

Since that talk i've had thoughts about him thinking differently about me now. (He hasn't treated me any different, i guess it's just me overthinking) Now that someone else knows about it, I can't pretend like it didn't happen anymore.

I am not sure if i should bring it up again and tell him about these feelings or if I should just let it be and forget about it."
750,1,"I experienced child hood sexual abuse for many years by my step dad and brother . I’ve been in EMDR since October weekly sessions . I’ve only ever cried twice . Once was when describing my mom abusing my dog , and another was describing my dad taking my siblings on vacation and leaving me home alone at short notice missing out . I cried when describing both of those. 

But when I describe my step dad raping me for years and grooming me I never cry and never have. Even the super graphic parts. When I describe my brother violently raping me I also never cry. I never feel emotional as I tell it even during emdr . But it affects me deeply evident by: nightmares about it frequently , ( those are going down due to emdr ) I really struggle to have sex with my loving partner but I make myself but the entire time I feel like I’m dirty and gross and like I’m having a flashback of being raped as a child , and intrusive flashbacks about it . 

My therapist thinks it’s important I feel the emotions That are buried deep with these experiences that impact me . 

Has anyone else experienced this? How did you get yourself to feel emotion about it? What helped ? 

Why do you think I cry about my dog but not me?

I have thought Ive only been depressed but now I think it’s not only depression. It’s actually living life from a glass box where one looks at life on the outside. I seem to act normally.

756,2,"I was involved in a car accident on February 1st, my sister’s birthday. I was in the left backseat with my mom in the middle seat, my sister on the right. We got t-boned on the left side, and spun into a ditch. Somehow, me and my mom were the only ones hurt. 

I had came home from college just the night before to come visit for her birthday. One moment we were leaving to go home from a restaurant and the next were in a ditch. I remember everything. I remember seeing the other cars headlights, the feeling of my spine being broken, not being able to move my leg out how badly it hurt. I remember seeing my mom laying lifeless next to me, and having to tell the emt’s all her information even though I was in excruciating pain. I remember getting carried out by an emt and how I had to get my clothes cut off. It still haunts me three months later. 

I’ve made almost a full recovery. I broke a lower part of my spine, my tailbone, and my pelvis. I cracked my meniscus and tore my acl as well. I spent the entire month of February in the hospital and rehab. My mom was there with me too, which was nice, but she doesn’t fully understand my mental issue. 

She doesn’t remember anything from the accident. She asks me to tell her about it, which I do, but it’s so hard. It’s so hard being the passenger for anybody else. If I’m riding with my dad, all I can think about is the accident because he was the driver. When I ride with my grandmother, who is prone to speed and swerve, I think about my death. Even when I’m trying to sleep, I dream about the accident. Nowhere is safe for my mind. 

I’m trying to get into therapy again, but even talking about it makes me prone to breaking down again. I never cried while in the hospital, mostly because that’s what everyone was expecting, and I wanted to seem strong. But im not. This accident has ruined everything that I enjoyed. Cruising with friends, taking naps, and even visiting relatives is hard. All of them are reminders. 

Going back to school is going to be even worse. Knowing my first year got cut off because of something that was out of my control. I can’t help but feel embarrassed everytime I go down there to figure stuff out for the school year. I just feel so weak. 

Sorry for the long post, I just discovered this subreddit. I needed a place to vent where I knew people would understand. "
757,2,"I had a dream about getting sa'd again yesterday. The trauma happened 11 years ago and I've had many triggers and issues because of it, but never dreams. Why did this only start now? Did this happen to anyone else?"
758,1,"




This is just one of my stories. I was raised by 2 narcissistic, psychopathic ex-guardians, 1 other narcissist woman who lived there for I don't know why at all, and the 2 adult children of the ex-guardians who were also depressed, narcissistic, and abusive, just like the other 3.



My entire life until age 18 I was constantly subjected to all forms of child abuse (sexual, physical, and all of the rest). The abuse came in all forms of abuse which exist.








As a kid, people gave me gifts, sometimes pets. I was, on two separate instances, given pet dogs.





Both were murdered by the ex-guardians. As a matter of fact, the 1 male ex-guardian took a video of one of the dogs, shortly before it was killed.





And he showed me the video.





I was once given a pet hamster as a gift. When I wasn't around, one of the abusive adult children of the narcissistic ex-guardians took the hamster.



She placed it in a small, empty fishbowl.



She then placed the fishbowl in the tiny space between a wall (a wall which was physically always hot) and a refrigerator; the hot, condenser-coil side of the refrigerator.




I cried, and I searched for the hamster for 12 hours.




The 1 abusive narcissistic woman (who as I stated lived there for I didn't even know why) pretended she did not see it; I later on learned that she actually did, but left the hamster exactly where it was.




The narcissist adult child (one of two) then proudly showed me the hamster which was almost dead, proudly stating that she did it because, and I quote:



""Because you don't deserve to have it.""




It was almost dead and rolling around in bits of its own extremely hot small poop droppings.




30 minutes later, the same adult child of the ex-guardians said:



""I never said that. I never did that.""



The hamster was dead a few days later, after biting me as it did not recognize me anymore.



The exact same thing, only on a bigger scale, was done to the other dog.





This March I turned 28; I was diagnosed with PTSD on two separate occasions as an adult and diagnosed as having C-PTSD just earlier this year.




I write songs about the abuse; I sometimes put the songs on YouTube if I want to.





Thank you for reading this part of my story.







#*I will add: The same abuser narcissist who placed the hamster in the fishbowl once watched as a stray dog barked at me and said, and I quote: ""That's what you get for thinking that every dog is your friend.""

760,2,that’s basically it. i was going to therapy semi consistently during fall/winter of 2023 and started to suspect that my poor mental health was due to a traumatic event i experienced in 2022. finally brought up the event to my therapist and she mentioned the possibility of PTSD but soon after i ghosted her and stopped going to therapy. i’m functioning well enough but i have bad moments and i wish i could get help but its too uncomfortable to deal with.

764,1,"Всем привет. Меня зовут Дима, мне 19 лет.
Мне просто безумно тяжело — не в физическом плане, а морально и ментально. И это не просто какой-то «подростковый загон», а реальная проблема, с которой я живу уже около 4 лет.

Объясню на простом примере: я постоянно меняю маски под разные компании людей, и это мешает мне нормально развиваться. Я не могу быть собой. Не могу найти того, кто действительно рядом, даже когда, казалось бы, всё должно быть хорошо — в отношениях, которые считаются ""прекрасным и чудесным"" временем. Хотя она мне нравится, я действительно хочу её видеть — но просто не могу быть ""нормальным"" рядом с ней.

Мне поставили диагноз: ПТСР, ОКР и депрессивное состояние.
Раньше я бы даже не стал писать это — посчитал бы глупостью и, может, посмеялся бы с себя. Но сейчас...
Сейчас у меня появляются навязчивые мысли: «А зачем мне всё это?», «А может...».
Они становятся всё чаще. Я стараюсь не обращать на них внимания, но они просто есть. Это неприятно.

Почти постоянно — апатия, сильная грусть, одиночество.
Хочется просто лечь, поспать и забыть каждый старый день. Пропустить новый.
Но не получается — я просыпаюсь по ночам по 4–5 раз, потом не могу уснуть из-за мыслей. И так — снова и снова.
Порой кажется, что эти мысли будят меня и преследуют даже во сне.

Сейчас всё сложно, потому что мысли не останавливаются.
Я не хочу, чтобы этот рассказ звучал как какая-то ""книга"". Может, позже добавлю что-то ещё. Сейчас — как есть.

Извините за сумбур и неструктурированность.
Просто очень много мыслей, и сил перебирать и упорядочивать их — нет.

765,2,"I don't know if this is a stupid question, and I'm not diagnosed. I'll be as blunt as possible. 

I'm 23 years old, moved back in with my parents, and can't find the motivation to get a job. Why am I here? Because when I've tried in the past to be independent, I've left jobs on a whim, went through internal pain in relationships, and I feel weighed down from failing. 

Why do I blame myself? Because I've recently realized I feel terrified of confrontation. I'm a people pleaser. If a time arises where I need to stand up for myself, I panic about it. Because I quite literally feel my body shake and my blood boil if I try to. I've lashed out in anger when trying to, and felt horrible afterwards. Literally melted down. 

Would witnessing a lot of physical violence in the family as a small child make this a possible PTSD response? "

767,3,"
Just feeling really gross about the whole situation and stuck over analyzing the whole thing. 
I just started with a new therapist, and it’s been years since I’ve been in therapy. So far, I’ve only talked about little things—stuff that’s happened during the week or practical things—but I really want to go deeper. I just feel scared and embarrassed to bring up the real stuff. I’ve been in an abusive relationship, and it’s so hard to say that out loud. This whole thing makes me feel like I’m going crazy.

I feel stuck—trapped in one way of thinking. I don’t trust people easily, and I keep reaching out to him and seeing him, even though I know it’s not good for me. A big part of me doesn’t want to start over.

Lately, I feel so disconnected from everything. Numb, anxious, like I’m just floating in my own head. I replay moments again and again, trying to make sense of them. I saw him again recently, and now I just feel stupid. I had ended the relationship months ago and was starting to feel okay. But now it feels like I’m being pulled back in.

We were together for five years. And even though there were good moments, there were also so many times I felt scared, powerless, and completely alone. Things would seem fine, then something awful would happen—and afterward, it was like it had never happened. I started questioning my own memory, my own reality.

I think I’ve been avoiding saying this, but I’m starting to realize the relationship was abusive. And now I’m stuck in this painful place where I feel conflicted. I don’t want to ruin his life. He has nothing—no money, no stability, serious mental health issues. But at the same time, what happened hurt me deeply. And I can’t pretend it didn’t.

His family ignores or excuses what he does. When I try to talk about it, I feel gaslit—not just by him, but by them too. It makes me question myself.

Here are some of the things I remember clearly:
	•	One time, I was crying and he slapped me across the face. The more I cried, the angrier he got.
	•	He once pushed me into a towel rack and dented it because I accidentally tossed his pants and they hit his face.
	•	He tried to force me to drink shroom tea. When I refused, he shoved it toward me until it spilled, then slapped me and called me a “stupid bitch.” He said I was the problem and called me a we*.
	•	He stormed into my apartment after drinking, screaming that I abandoned him. He threw my things around, ripped my shirt off, and physically restrained me. My roommate had to kick him out.
	•	The first time he grabbed my neck, I was half-naked. Afterward, I had to do a Zoom meeting with a scratchy voice. When I brought it up, he claimed it was sexual and said I was exaggerating.
	•	He would refuse to drive me to work unless we had sex. If I cried or was late, he’d threaten not to take me.
	•	During sex, if he was frustrated or couldn’t get aroused, he’d pinch me, pull my hair, and call me names. He’d accuse me of cheating or being a “bitch.”
	•	Once, he climbed on top of me and hit me in the head several times because I accidentally hit his eye with his pants.
	•	He drove erratically, pulling my hair and saying we’d both die because I talked about leaving. I had a full-blown panic attack.
	•	He choked me—multiple times. Not for long, but enough to terrify me.
	•	He wouldn’t let me go to the bathroom during sex. Even when I was crying, he wouldn’t let me stop.
	•	His cousin once overheard me crying during a fight and came in. He got even angrier and blamed me for someone seeing me like that.
	•	When his brother was staying in the same room, he made me have sex with him in the bathroom. I felt humiliated but didn’t know how to say no.
	•	He used to “inspect” me to check if I’d been with anyone else, while he himself was cheating.
	•	Once, he bit my face in anger and held me down, poking me in the chest while I cried.
	•	I believe, early in our relationship, he may have done something sexual to me while I was half asleep after getting high. It’s blurry, but it still haunts me.
	•	If I said something hurt or I didn’t want to continue during sex, he’d make fun of me, say I was lying, or keep going.
	•	He called me a sl*, a we*, a cheater—just for wanting to see my friends or family. Meanwhile, he was the one lying and cheating.

I hate admitting this, but sometimes I gave in to sex because I was afraid of what he’d do if I said no. I’d cry during or after and feel like my body didn’t belong to me anymore. Sometimes he wouldn’t let me get dressed or would make me stay in certain positions until he was ready.

One time, neighbors heard me crying and him yelling. He was throwing things, screaming threats through the wall, calling them w****s, saying he’d kill them. Later, he blamed me for everything.

So why do I still feel conflicted?

He has trauma. Mental health issues. A part of me still wants him to be okay. But none of that justifies what he did.

Does this count as abuse?
Is it sexual assault if I was crying, saying I didn’t want to keep going, and he didn’t let me stop?

I feel like I’m going crazy trying to make sense of it all. And even now, I feel guilty. I can’t bring myself to report anything—he’s already lost everything. He’s homeless because I left. But I’m still carrying all of this pain, and I don’t know what to do with it."
768,2,"I still see that knife whenever it’s dark. It was almost a year ago—walking home from work down that side street I’d taken a hundred times. One second I was humming along to my podcast, the next there was a figure in a hoodie pressing cold steel against my ribs. 

I didn’t feel pain, just raw panic, as he barked at me to hand over my purse. My hands shook so hard I dropped everything. He yanked me toward an alley, tore my bag off me, and then he was gone—leaving me curled against a wall, gasping for air.

Last night at 11:23 PM, I woke to the hum of my building’s parking garage door. It screeched open and my heart exploded in my chest. I bolted upright, sheets wrapped around me like a shield, convinced someone was coming for me again. I pressed my back against the wall and stayed there for twenty minutes, listening to every car engine and creak in the hallway, waiting for a knife to appear.

This morning I dragged myself into the office two hours late, eyes rimmed red. My boss frowned when I slumped into his doorway and mumbled, “Sorry…had a rough night.” He crossed his arms and said, “Again?” I tried to explain the panic attacks, how the garage noise got to me—but he shook his head. “You’ve been here nearly a year now. Maybe find a different route, or just…toughen up?” His tone was almost impatient, like I was choosing to complain.

At lunch, I sat outside by the entrance—too afraid to go back down the stairs. A coworker passed and asked, “You okay? You’ve been off lately.” I nodded and forced a smile. Inside, I was replaying the mugging over and over—the way the knife glinted, the mugger’s voice echoing in my ears. I bit my lip until it bled to stop myself from crying in front of everyone.

The rest of the day was a nightmare. Every time my phone buzzed, my hand flew to my pocket, expecting a threat. Every shadow in the stairwell looked like someone stepping out of the darkness. When I spilled coffee on my shirt, I froze—thinking maybe someone had shoved me into it.

Now I’m home, lights on in every room, curtains wide open, and still I can’t settle. I keep glancing at the front door, waiting for it to burst open. I texted my roommate: “I don’t know if I can do this alone tonight,” and she replied, “Just lock the door and try to sleep.” Like that was any kind of help.

So I’m here, typing this because maybe you know what it’s like to walk through your own apartment as if it were the scene of a crime. Maybe you’ve sat on your couch, hands gripping the cushions, waiting for a memory to drag you back into that alley. Maybe you understand how exhaustion doesn’t come from long days, but from endless nights spent wide awake in terror.

I don’t have answers. I just needed to say it out loud: that mugging didn’t end when he ran off—it’s chasing me into every dark corner, every quiet moment, every breath I try to take. Thanks for listening.

769,2,"I'm a bit lost at the minute and although it's really recent this sub seemed fitting. I was in a potentially really dangerous accident less than a week ago, a car pulled out on me riding my motorbike. Miraculously I've avoided the main impact, a near by tree and ended up landing on grass.
 
I'm sore down my left side but nothings broken, I've got two tiny bruises and thankful to be alive. But I'm struggling to deal with the mental side of it.

I feel weak because I'm fine, but my mind keeps spinning round on the fact of you should be injured. Sheer luck avoided it and sheer bad luck made me there at that exact moment, I'm grateful yet angry as hell at the same time.

The nurse described it as near death experience but I've barely got a scratch on me, is that really near death? I have rarely cried in the last ten years but 20 minutes after the crash through to now it's almost all I've wanted to do. 

Can someone validate me with experience? Any tips on how to deal with the anguish? "
770,3,"i am autistic and due to this i feel a huge amount of empathy and whenever she is off or sad i can tell straight away and it affects my mood too. she has PTSD and she basically just shuts down and any semblance of herself disappears. she basically just becomes a shell of herself, she starts small talking me and acting like she barely knows me. when this is not happening, we have such an amazing relationship. i’m crazy in love with her and i’d love us to be able to be together forever and we’ve both spoken about how we would love this. 

however, i just don’t know how to cope when she does this. even though she reassures me that she’s not off because of me, i can’t help but feel like i’ve done something wrong. i just don’t know how to help in these situations as she says that if she tells me what’s wrong it ‘becomes real’. we then end up in a situation where we’re both upset and we just kind of get frustrated with each other. the solution could be to just not see each other when one of us feels bad (the same happens when i’m upset, she just shuts down) but obviously that’s not healthy or sustainable. i’m just not sure where to go because neither of us really know what to do. i know that relationships can’t be all good but it’s affecting my mental health and i just want to be able to help her. does anyone have any advice??"
771,1,"I feel so alone in this. I'm still in a lot of pain that's indescribable and people just don't get it. This happened in the later half of last year. I get mad at people thinking I can just get over this quickly, someone like a sibling going missing is the worst pain I have felt. I'm just looking for people that know this pain to relate to, not to be able to relate to my entire experience but I will get it off my chest.  

Last year, my brother went missing and was homeless on the streets. I lost my entire mind. I am 26, he is 29. My mom told me he was missing-- this story gets complicated but apparently he wasn't missing, she knew where he was-- the general area and people he was seeing the whole time but my mom filed a false missing person's report  to protect herself and I also was working with the detective on the case. So I went searching for my brother for I think two months mostly on my own. I became homeless, living in my car for 2 months, I was dealing with a stalking situation she was aware of and I was so heartbroken from my brother's situation. I knew my brother's mental health (schizophrenia) was getting worse and she was abusing him and making him so much worse to the point he was on hard drugs on the streets. My brother ran into oncoming traffic in front of me two times. I made posts on Facebook and instagram to help find him. Before he was ""missing"", my mom said ""I wish he'd gtfo of my house and just go live on the street"". 

Anyway, I know there are so many traumas in that. I don't normally share the whole story with anyone and that's not even all of it, but I've found when only sharing that my brother went missing to anyone-- nobody gets it, I'm not saying people who I share that with don't express any empathy, but truly it's isolating realizing it's a trauma that takes one to know one. "
772,2,"Idk if this is ‘PTSD’ but I don’t know where else to post. 

I made a fourth suicide attempt (OD) in January, and have since been dealing with flashbacks that come with intense nausea and feeling like my throat is closing up, as well the obvious emotional distress. Almost the whole day today I’ve felt on the verge of throwing up (triggered by having to take some pills this morning). This happens every time I take or even contemplate taking medication, but I’m currently on antibiotics and I can’t avoid doing it. 

I’m begging for advice. I need to take my meds but I spend the whole day crippled with distress and nausea, dreading the next batch. Please, anything anyone can recommend to help manage this would be so greatly appreciated."
773,2,"Hello, 
I have a question. For the last couple of months every session I dissociate even if we aren’t talking about trauma. The longest I have dissociated was 12 minutes in session. 

If you feel comfortable, how long have you dissociated for?"
774,3,"Looking for advice on dealing with my mom, as I don't want to give up on our relationship. She has a habit of making excuses for people who harm me. Example: My father was abusive to her and us kids. My earliest memories are of him physical abusing her (there was a massive difference in size, and she had no way to fight back). He was a raging alcoholic and I was terrified of him. He eventually left and wanted nothing to do with us, then had an overdose and died. She would always make excuses for him, usually that he had a hard life, was confused, etc. As a kid, any time I'd bring up how he'd hurt me, she'd just say how much he really loved us, just couldn't express it. It was always difficult and made me feel like shit.

This behavior has never really changed, and I feel it's on the brink of ruining my relationship with her. For example, there was a recent event with a family member which my mom witnessed. They were incredibly cruel to me, just further demonstrating a lifetime of them treating me like shit. It was a very hurtful situation. She kept saying ""there was no excuse for that, it was just cruel!"", but finally adds how their intention was just that they care about me and they are just mixed up so it came out in an awful way. (Reality: that person doesn't give a damn shit about me, and has been violating me my entire life.)

It really pushed me over the edge. It makes me feel so alone and gross and so many things. I really blew up at her, which I've never truly done, and now we both feel like shit. I really don't want to lose my mom, but this is such a theme throughout my life. I'm looking for advice on:

* Understanding her behavior more, what causes this, and how to react to it in a constructive way (I know she isn't intentionally trying to be hurtful, this is just some bizarre outlook)
* Trying to understand if I'm over-reacting
* How to save this relationship, as currently I've grown very resentful and bitter towards her over these things

When I confront her about it she will get upset saying ""I never said it was right!"" but she doesn't get it, it's not that I think she's excusing the behavior, it's that she always tells me these people who have abused me really loved me and had good intentions. That's the hurtful part."
775,1,"Was it SA? Please.

Hello. I cant sleep, its been on my mind for years. I don’t know how to warn this because i don’t even know what it was but jesus christ it just gnaws at me. I need help finding out if what happened to me was sexual assault or not.

Trigger warnings for abuse / sexual assault (?) 

-

Incident 1. 
*I believe I was 10 at the time. It was around 2 am, woke up to my mom on top of me. She weighs like 400lbs, was fucking crushing me. She kept kissing all over my face and was actually suffocating me, once she stopped i was in so much pain i couldn’t breathe, dont remember the rest.*

-

Incident 2, what i consider what broke me. 
*Was 14-15 at the time. I was sleeping in my room taking a nap. Woke up to my mom coming onto my bed. I was sleeping on my stomach but flipped over when my mom came in, i looked her in the eyes as she towered over me, then i remember ending up on my back. My mom grinding her crotch up against my ass and grunting into my ear. She had me pinned down since she was so heavy, i kept screaming and crying but nobody heard me. After around 2 minutes she got off, we were both almost off the bed. Before she left, she just looked at me and said i didn’t love her.*

*When i confronted her about this-  ( she went through my diary and saw i was calling her an abuser, more shit happened before- like insane shit but whatever thats not important right now ) she said she was just trying to love me.*

-

??? Am i fucking insane, was this SA? Can it even be? We both had our clothes on, its not like she groped me, i dont think she meant it like that, shes just fucking demented, she shits on the floor and acts like a goddamn toddler so i really have no idea whats up with her. "
776,0,Idk anymore is this normal?
777,1,"I’m 17F. I’ve been abused,bullied,raped,assaulted multiple times since 8, I’ve reported it to the police and school and everywhere but everything I’ve been said it’s not a big deal. I’m wasting their time. They can’t do anything all that shit. Recently I commited a crimed. It was no where near as bad. I’m no longer allows to go to college. And my life is ruined.

I know crime isn’t good edpeciallly now. But I’ve reported so much to the police and no one kept me safe. If I got hurt now I’d know I’d deserve it but back then I was innocent and no one cared about what happened to me. I even had severe crime commited against me like I kidnapping and attemoted murder. Nothing was done.
 
I’m actually in shock that I commited crimes no where near as bad and my life is over. I know deep down crimes bad but honestly when I was doing it I didn’t even think my role was bad especially because what happened to me was way worse and “no big deal”.

Now I’m waiting beibg charged. Been told I’m now allowed to go to college. My life is over. I’m so drunk to deal with this it’s crazy. I thought starting college even though it was late would be a good new start but none. I can’t handle it anymore.

I get crime is bad. But what I did want life ruining to anyone else. What happened to me changed me as a person. I honestly thought what I did wouldn’t be caught. Because I thought well what I did wasn’t as bad as what happened to me which ruined my entire life. But now my life HAS been ruined. And I feel so extremely suicidal. It’s crazy. 

I used to be a bit obsessive abour not breaking the law before all that stuff happened to me and ruined me socially,academically,philsically,mentally. Now I thought I could do whatever no concequences. 

Now I’ve ruined my life even more and I just feel so suicidal. Because I thought I could do practically whatever I wanted.

I’m really drunk tonight because I’m so depressed and suicidal but even being drunk it barely even helped. I know deep down I deserve punishment but it fucks me up  that what they did was life ruining to me and I got NO justice. For years but my first ever crime no where near as bad is considered to be deserved of being life ruining.
"
778,2,"I have PTSD and both of my parents are abusive but my mother specifically has caused my PTSD. She is an alcoholic and hoarder which the hoarding specifically I still have nightmares about 15 years later. However- my brain definitely protected itself because all the memories are hazzy. 

What I don't understand is if I was sexually abused by her. My parents divorced when I was young and my mother became very emotionally incestuous with my younger brother and I. I took on the parental roles over my brother and comforting my mother. Something that may provide context is I am Transmasc and my brother is a trans man so we were both raised as daughters. My mother would constantly make us feel bad anytime we were upset with her by saying , ""no one loves me"". 

Anyways, my mother is very controlling. She dressed us way past an age that was ""normal"". She bathed us way past what was normal. Where I question the sexual abuse is she use to go on and on about how our feet smelled like ""roses"" and she would suck on my toes. Again my memories are hazzy but I know I must've been 8 or older and it definitely made me uncomfortable. She did this many times. 

Another situation was, I remember taking a bath with her when I was 5. She was explaining to me breast feeding and told me to suck on her nipple. This honestly makes me the most sick to my stomach. But movies like Grown Ups try to act like it's just funny. She taught me about ""sex"" at a very young age, probably 5? It was all formated to be ""educational"" but I feel uncomfortable thinking about it. 

I don't think she got sexual gratification from it necessarily but it makes me feel sick in a way that my other traumas don't. Its harder to talk about and think about. I feel she did enjoy the power she had over me- and to my understanding that is at the core of child sexual abuse. 

I am easily able to recognize my brother was sexually abused but his goes steps further. He remembered recently that my mother would apply ointment to his genitals way past the age where he could do it himself. 

I appreciate any validation. My brother and I have gone no contact and are safe."
779,2,"Recently I have been having intense flashbacks post orgasm with my boyfriend. Theres no specific memory attached but immediately after I cum I feel INTENSE physical discomfort and I writhe and hit myself and say things in distress.

My boyfriend is incredible, truthfully. This has often happened before he cums and he immediately stops and soothes me and never pressures us to return to sex. He holds me in my distress and lets me talk about it and we just cuddle. He usually makes me cum first and I have caused it a few times where he can’t finish so I suggested we start making him cum first instead. 

Anyway… what is going on? Why would this happen all of a sudden? I have never had this happen to me. I do have sexual trauma.  

But he is the most respectful partner I have. I have never felt so safe and comfortable advocating for my body (what feels good, what feels safe for me). He never has any issue with me stopping sex or rejecting him. So theres no sexual pressure. 

Why is happening? How do I orgasm without it being ruined?? Anyone else going through this? "
780,2,"Im 19 and have CPTSD and have for years. Last October (around a trauma anniversary I had some kind of psychotic break and was experiencing auditory and visual hallucinations. I would hear voices that tell me to do things and would threatened me if I didn't do as they asked. I would see shadows in the lights and was convinced that shadows had cameras on me. I was placed in a mental health unit because of this. All the psychiatrist I have spoken to say that this isn't a separate disorder and my hallucinations are all linked to my CPTSD, but l've never seen anyone else speak about having hallucinations because of CPTSD and trauma. Does anyone else have this?"
781,2,"I work as a social worker and am currently doing a course online. One of the other participants in the course could pass for the twin of a person who offended against me. This offender almost took my life about 10 years ago, along with subjecting me to relentless atrocities.

I’ve had flashbacks and trauma reminders for years, but seeing this person (who is definitely not the person who hurt me) is really unnerving. I had to change my
Zoom settings so that I couldn’t see his face, but then every time he’d speak, his image was front and centre and I found it hard to breathe.

I feel so stupid.

I know it’s not him. I know the offender has no power over me any more and I’m safe. I just feel so weak for feeling so impacted.

We are are attending this course in person tomorrow and I am dreading seeing him and potentially having to speak with him.

I’ve had lot of therapy, and will be going to see someone again soon, but damn this is hard. Just needed to share it. Thanks."
782,1,"I used to tell my parents, that I'd never be like my brother. I wouldn't smoke, wouldn't drink, etc. Now, I do it constantly as some sort of a reprieve. I'm scared of death, but I do shit that speeds it up. I can't even stop. 

I wonder like, who I've become. I want revenge but I know it won't *really* help anything. But fuck. It might be the least I could do. 

How do I help myself ?"
783,3,"I’m seperating from the military for a medical issue unrelated to my mental health. However, as a part of the process, I have to see a psychologist. Because other doctors I have seen have actually told me they are leaving information out of my record, to include my PTSD diagnosis, out of risk for my career (which does not exist anymore, at least not in the military) it is really important I give as much information to the psychologist as possible to get my diagnosis officially recorded and the symptoms I experience. Its not just important so i get disability or whatever, but its important so i’ll be able to get treatment for it through the VA in the future if they get the extent of it recorded now.

In the past, and recently within the past year, when i “trauma dump” things get really bad. My symptoms get so much worse, everything else gets worse, and i am excessively stressed for about a week after. Thinking about doing all of that again has me already panicking. This is also a big reason why i quit therapy.

Conversely, i also have a hard time explaining things in general. I nervously laugh which makes people take me less seriously. I also almost go on “autopilot” and end up seeming friendly or “fine” when explaining and then i fall apart afterwards. I honestly dont feel like its me when i do this, and i really dont notice how casual i come off until later when i deal with the repercussions and wish i could have been more authentic with my answers. Its really frustrating coming back to someone who thinks my problems arent a big deal when i spent the last few days shaking and having nightmares because of that interaction. For some reason i just realise afterwards i smiled and said i was fine when they asked me how i am doing, just to repeat the process. Honestly, idk whats wrong with me and why i cant just be realistic.

Either way, i’m not sure what to do to make any of this easier. I think im gonna make a note to say at the beginning that i tend to nervously laugh and have a hard time expressing my feelings towards things. Maybe since it’ll be on telehealth i can hold something in my hand to help me focus? I’m really not sure what else i can do other than expect it to suck and really focus on not brushing things off during the interview. I’d be grateful for any advice. Thank you."
784,0,Seriously?! What's up with that! Gee thanks 🫠
785,2,"Cross posted on multiple subs b/c I need help rn and im convincing myself no one will take that as me being an attention seeker 🙃 a favorite word in my childhood home for well.. everything 

TW-CSA non graphic , EDs, physical violence 

To TLDR it- 

Grew up with a physically violent, tyrant, whose favorite thing to do was choke me and my mother when he flew into rages.. and lots of gaslighting, woman hating, mom was an alcoholic and has Anorexia,  so I have AN, but stay TF away from alcohol and she conveniently went on biweekly business trips for several days at a time so I was alone with him often, he was unpredictable and loved to change the rules randomly.. idk my home life was HELL.. I definitely have zero self esteem and confidence and worth DIRECTLY related to him calling me stupid and saying I'll fail at everything.. im a perfectionist now. 
Hopefully that gives you a sense of things..

What happened that caused me to not be able to go back into denial land---  abridged 

I have Anorexia and have since I was idk 8 or so probably younger  recently started trying to recover and the FEELINGS omg.. usually when I get an intrusive thought ""my Father molested me"" I can bop it away like a balloon, since I started trying to recover.. its more like a 1000 lb weight and I have so so many of the signs both in childhood and adulthood but mostly.. I just KNOW 
So obviously everyone's lives have continued on and externally mine has too but internally im a WRECK,

I have vague ""memories"" but nothing magically concrete and I don't know if I trust my brain at this age tbh (35 now) Its mostly just a felt thing idk how to explain it.. 

Things like-

 Imagining my childhood bedroom makes me nauseous and panicky.

My parents tiny glass shower downstairs  is involved somehow

ICK when I think about any of this followed VERY closely by self hate and then a desire to SH (I won't)


Obviously no one can tell me for sure and im not looking for that.. more suggestions to idk find my sanity and make the world around me feel ""real"" again and matter?? 

Also how to stop the intrusive thoughts.

Any book/workbook recommendations.

Idk 😢 thanks for reading  "
786,1,"I will never understand people that flat out refuse to listen to CA victims or think a child would just lie about this. I tried to tell other adults for years and no one listened to me or protected me. 

Here’s to phrases I hate and hope to never hear said to anyone ever again:


“You’re X years old what problems could you have?”

“You’re an only child you’re probably spoiled” (No one protected me)

“You know how kids are, suddenly they hate their dad because he took away their phone” 

“Parents always want what’s best for you” said to me every time I tried to speak up with whatever limited vocabulary I had 

And the WORST is when I see more people that truly believe that a child would just persistently make up or exaggerate abuse. Literally what would any child get out of that? 

"
787,3,"So I just started last night and while I still woke up several times and I think I had nightmares they seemed more hazy, I didn't feel like I had to stay awake and distance myself from it before going back to sleep. I did feel groggy in the morning. I'm really hoping it works I just learned about this drug and I feel like my quality of life would be much better if I could get away from the constant nightmares. I honestly don't know what sleep is like without nightmares without being completely sedated. Does the grogginess in the morning go away? "
788,2,"Do you think anxiety is just... worry?  
Like overthinking, biting nails, pacing rooms? Well, it’s not.  
Anxiety is drowning  
in a room full of air.  
It’s your heart sprinting a marathon  
while your body forgets how to move.  
It’s a thousand alarms going off,  
and you can’t find the fire.  
Because there is no fire.  
Just the smoke.  
Everywhere.  
It’s forgetting how to breathe—  
not like “take a deep breath,”  
but like—  
your lungs are locked.  
Like someone changed the code,  
and you weren’t told.  
It’s walking into a coffee shop  
and feeling like the ceiling will collapse,  
the floor will crack.  
You don’t live with anxiety  
You survive it.  
Every. Damn. Day.  
And the worst part?  
It’s invisible.  
You look fine.  
You sound fine.  
But inside,  
your body’s bracing for impact  
from something that never comes.  
And still—  
you smile.  
You go to work.  
You pick up the phone.  
You keep going.  
Because that’s what you’ve trained yourself to do.  
Because stopping  
feels like dying.

790,2,"Something crazy happened to me while visiting the place that I got unexpectadly robbed in, suddenly i felt like myself again. I realised that after that event ive been living in a complete chaos inside my mind even though I’ve gotten used to it, the hypervigilance and anxiety and the feeling of impending doom and not knowing who I am suddenly lifted and I was present. If i just could reach that state all the time :( "
791,3,"My symptoms get way worse when I'm sleep deprived but when I'm doing really poorly I avoid sleeping because I'm scared to close my eyes. I stay up for hours until I can't keep myself awake, then I wake up at 4 or 5 am and  go on my phone to keep myself from thinking. Then I feel horrible all day and the cycle continues the next night and over time I get more and more sleep deprived and worse at my job which makes me feel worse about myself which exacerbates my PTSD symptoms. 

Does anyone else do this? How do you break out of your cycle?"
792,2,"When I was 7, I was learning to cycle with my older brother. We were crossing a road when a huge truck came out of nowhere and screeched to a halt just inches from us. Ever since then, the sound of screeching tires sends me back to that moment.

793,3,"I’m in my early 20s right now, still living at home but when I’m able to move out, I’ll most likely distance myself from my parents for a while.

I’ve been trying to sort out some past traumatic experiences between cases of childhood neglect and sexual assault that I’m unpacking. 

Today I had a flashback that really overwhelmed me. I couldn’t distinguish between events and it was shocking. 

When I was assaulted, my assaulter backed me into a corner while I was naked and masturbated himself. He made me call him daddy. 

Today I remembered that my parents used the ‘naughty corner’ method to discipline me growing up. I must have blocked it out but today I remembered that as a toddler, there were times that I was made to stand in a corner naked. 

I know that method is common for toddlers but I can’t believe I forgot I was 14/15ish and my parents still handled discourse with this method. 

I’ve been feeling an overwhelming amount of shame since finishing college and trying to process this trauma. It’s become clear to me that my parents are unreliable supports to help me process this. 

They’ve continually called me crazy and ridiculous for being skittish and scared around them. If I can’t fix my relationship with my parents, I at least need to learn how to get a grip. What can I do?"
794,1,"I talked to my therapist today and I was like... Well I can't have PTSD because I don't have any ""trauma"". And he was like NO you DEFINITELY have trauma. And it kinda killed me a little bit. I've stopped taking my meds for like 3 weeks. Not all of them. Just one of them. My old med was causing weight gain so we replaced it with a new one and I never started taking the new one. I am doing this on purpose. I want to hurt myself. I have always wanted to hurt myself. But when I cut myself people notice. Stopping taking one med makes me spiral into a depression with lots of spacing out and memories and derealization. It's the perfect way to hurt myself without anyone knowing. But I told my therapist and he was like you should get back on your meds but I am not finished hurting myself. I just hate myself so much and I want to hurt myself. It's so simple but I know it's bad. But I do it anyways because it feels good in a way. 

  
Anyone else ever feel like this?"

How does a person without a writing background even begin writing/publishing a memoir?"
797,1,My therapist says practice self compassion. My self compassion today is eating 3 ice cream sandwiches in a bubble bath. I’ve never felt so depressed. Does anyone else have weird coping mechanisms? 
798,2,"In 2024, I was arrested for a false report. After seeking medical attention, I was diagnosed with PTSD from significant trauma in my life. At the time that I was arrested, I was having a PTSD flashback. I was convicted of false report and disorderly conduct without my condition being taken into consideration. I am wondering how you deal with your PTSD? I have nightmares of my childhood trauma, of the body violation that happened to me which led to this PTSD flashback, and now with severe fear of police. To top it off, I have been applying to felony friendly employers with no resolve and when I go to my probation officer, she just says I don’t know why they won’t hire you because they are “felony friendly”
I keep going through this over and over and over in my head, and if I would have known that taking a plea bargain would have affected employment (I was told it wouldn’t)  I would have gone to trial. Even though I know it would have retraumatized me to see the person who violated me, to see the police who were not understanding, and to have to try to explain to the general public that I have PTSD, which is something that society doesn’t really understand. It’s a really hopeless feeling some days.
"
799,1,"Update: I'm working on getting an appointment with a new therapist and have already found several in my area. thank you so much to everyone who commented; it made switching therapist feel so much more doable. I'm coming through this feeling hopeful instead of depressed.

  


For context, both my parents are abusive (mostly emotional abuse), but they gave me PTSD and severe depression, which is why I'm in therapy. I still live with them because I'm too sick to work, and I don't feel like I'm in physical danger.

For starters, my therapist is pushing me to move out even though I can't work and I would literally be homeless. ""Most people would rather be homeless than live under the conditions you do,"" she said. Pushing someone to be homeless seemed really irresponsible to me, but I let that pass. She talks like I just need to leave, and ""push through"" in order to hold down a job. I started crying and told her that I was already pushing myself to my limit, but she just doubled down and talked about how everything in life is a choice, and I can turn my life around by changing my choices (aka, by leaving). (I literally started sobbing, but she kept it up.)

By the way, resources for the mentally ill or homeless in my area are really scarce and inadequate.

Also, when I'd told her about the way my mom used to deliberately do things to hurt me when I was a very small kid, she didn't seem to believe me. She didn't say that directly, but she said something like, ""Well, I wasn't there, so I only have your perception to go on,"" and then talked about how sometimes when we get hurt repeatedly, it starts to feel intentional. (My mom is a literal sadist. She's put fingernail clippings in my drink once and pushed me to take pills she knew could easily kill me.) I felt like my therapist might as well have said she didn't believe me.

That phrase ""everything in life is a choice"" really got to me. I don't feel like it would be smart for me to move out right now, and she made me feel like I wasn't ""trying hard enough"" at life. She made me feel like I was at fault for my crappy situation.

Edit: thanks to everyone! You helped me through a really, really bad day."
800,2,Does anyone know any psychiatrist on here that specializes in war ptsd or someone who has war ptsd ? I don’t want therapy session i just want to ask some questions because i am a mess
801,1,"Had a pretty bad flashback on Saturday and I still don’t feel completely right and feel very off, I was doing very well mentally until this very severe flashback and now it feels like my trauma just happened even though it was YEARS ago. "
802,2,"Hey - thanks for bothering. 

Disclaimer - i understand my trauma might be nothing compared to what some people on this thread have gone through. I’m just scared for myself is all. 

Short Trauma Dump - In the past, let my male best friend convince me that keeping my head in his lap, holding hands and sleeping, sleeping on his shoulder were all platonic. Let him kiss my neck, forehead and cheeks. Was deprived of touch severely - froze at first, but i allowed it. Started getting panic attacks when he touched me. Wasn’t attracted to him, didnt have male friends prior, realised it was a horrible mistake. Hated myself, shamed myself. Distanced from him. He became persuasive, stalker-y “you dont wanna come to my house / give me your passwords cause you dont trust me” types. Anywho - 
 
TLDR: i now have a paralysing fear everytime someone doesnt accept a “no” in one go. Give in to peer pressure more often. 

Context- matched with a guy on Hinge. He’s in town for 2 more weeks. Medium ugly / medium cute. Very different from my type, red flag probability of 70%, predator probability of 50%. Goes to a good uni, is a consultant. Wants to have the first meeting at home. Swears wont do anything funny, will leave before sundown. I’ve been lonely and touch starved lately. While i’ve forgiven myself for the trauma (took 8 months) still carry the fear though

Advice - i’m in my mid twenties. Really wanted to wait for the right guy to have a kiss/hookup with because i know the trauma will leave me feeling cheap/dirty if i dont trust someone. But also i’m super horny and want to not be left behind in life because the healing takes so much time. Should i give in and hookup? Healing-is-not-linear-kinda way or should i abstain? He-will-mess-you-up-more kinda way? 

I’m super down in life so everything severely affects my mental health hehe

Thanks for reading so much - appreciate your two cents. "
803,1,"I was abused when i was a teen for a few years, all kind of stuff. A few weeks ago i tried magic mushrooms and while i loved the trip i remembered so much about those times that i've forgotten. I'm not sure how to feel about it. It was as good as bad for me i feel. Any ideas?"
804,0,"I recently listened to the Diary of a CEO talk with Georgia Ede and started listening to her book now.
Very interesting, she says a Leto diet can help with depression and all kinds of mental burdens, because oftentimes the brain gets insulin resistant from eating a SAD diet and getting too many simple carbs.

Makes a lot of sense to me so far.

I am a vegetarian so it’s not an option for me to go on a carnivore diet, but I was wondering if anyone got on a ketogenic diet and saw any differences in PTSD symptoms.

Any input appreciated! "
805,0,"     So my grandfather was a paratrooper in Vietnam, and I would love to interview him about his experience. What are some questions that I should avoid asking, aside from the obvious, “Have you killed anyone?”"
806,3,"I had an amazing therapist a couple of years ago and it really helped me. I'm diagnosed with PTSD, Generalised Anxiety disorder, panic disorder and OCD. However after treatment 2 years ago 90% of symptoms went away. I haven't had a panic attack, flashback or trauma related nightmare for nearly a year.

I'm under a lot of stress at the moment. Company I work for is making redundancies and I'm unsure if I'll keep my job. Rent and tenancy is needing to be renegotiated and it's unreasonable so we might have to move. And I'm living with and caring for a sick relative who is dying. 

My trauma (amongst other things) was over my father being an alcoholic and me seeing him in hospital repeatedly and also regarding us resultantly becoming poor to the point of homelessness when I was a child. 

So it's like a triple threat of my triggers. The flashbacks, panic attacks and nightmares have come back. I'm scared to sleep. Even if I don't have a nightmare of the specific trauma event - my dreams are of similar hypothetical things happening to my loved ones. I keep having vivid intense intrusive thoughts about losing a loved one. I can't sleep more than 3 or for hours in a 24 hour period.

My therapist taught me a lot of techniques to cope and they have worked before. But the stress is taking its toll on me. It'll be months before I can see a therapist. What should I do about relapsing in the mean time?

"
807,1,"Hi everyone,

I am a therapist with C-PTSD. I have been in therapy since I was 7 years old, and I have seen numerous therapists who use a variety of modalities. I have attachment wounds and a history of traumatization as a child and adult. I have made progress in therapy, and I have had major setbacks.

I stopped seeing a therapist in February 2024, I worked with her for 5 years. At one point, I had a solid relationship with her, until I was in an abusive relationship in 2023 and she gave me the ultimatum to continue working with her or continue dating him. I initially chose him, until the abuse escalated and I was abandoned in another town in the middle of nowhere, not even Uber. Her conditions were that I was broken up with him for 72 hours. I eventually did that after the escalation occurred. I couldn't trust her again and wasn't making progress, and I never understood why until I was out of the relationship with her.

Then I started seeing a new therapist in February 2024 who also owns an IOP. I was SA'ed in January 2024, and much of my unresolved SA trauma history was catching up to me, which led to me needing more intensive help. I started attending an Intensive Outpatient Program that has a process-oriented approach to therapy. At first, it was helpful. It felt very different than most of my past experiences in therapy, but it gave me hope. Then a new group facilitator started at the IOP. My therapist who owns the IOP was a part of hiring her, and the new therapist's approach often felt invalidating, detached, unhelpful, and retraumatizing. While I recognize my own life history plays a role into the way I saw her, I was hoping my therapist who is her boss, would help me resolve that internal conflict that arose with her, rather than push it away. I told him that she activated a lot of old wounds over and over again. When I would tell him, he would get frustrated, defensive, and activated in himself.

I requested a facilitated discussion to resolve this conflict, since I did not feel safe enough directly approaching her as I tried to do that multiple times, but each time I attempted she was fairly dismissive to my bids for connection. I verbally requested to my primary therapist several times for a facilitated discussion. She would often operate outside of her scope of practice and give excessive nutrition and supplement advice to people, she had an approach that appeared to be at times in line with toxic positivity, and she told someone in group who began to cry once, ""You always do this,"" which was not in a compassionate tone, it was dismissive. She told someone who was permanently disabled from a stroke that they can heal their injuries through natural methods, and he just needs to believe he can physically get better, then he won't be disabled. There were a ton more instances of really unhelpful and inappropriate comments this therapist made, but that is not the point here. I told my individual therapist who is the owner of the IOP and her boss, and he never actually addressed these things with her, and never facilitated a discussion with me, him and her, like I requested, and he told me he would do at one point in time. I was allegedly excessively projecting and triangulating, which I don't doubt that my own transference played a role, but the requests to resolve the root cause of the rupture, which was with her, was never truly dealt with.

Fast forward, my individual therapist (the owner) was facilitating a group, and all the group members were saying their grievances about this other newer therapist. His response was to have us bring these grievances up in the moment. He knows that I get really triggered by the things she said, and many of the things she said had led to numerous crises in my life and decompensation in my condition. The next day, this new therapist facilitates the group. She said something that really triggered me and led me to crying. She asked after several minutes of me crying what was going on, and I told her that what she said triggered me. She denied what she said and immediately got defensive. Then after a bit she admitted to saying it. I had a complete verbal anger outburst towards her after she gaslit me, and told her I never felt safe around her and told her that she pushes people's pain away and she perpetuates shame-based narratives of emotional expression. Anger outbursts are not in my character, but the context was this was after months of not being heard and just begging to have this resolved in a therapeutic way with my primary therapist. I said I should just die, and there was no suicide assessment, no debrief after group, absolutely nothing from her.

The next morning, my primary therapist recommended me to go to Residential Treatment. So, I went. I researched the best place in the country and I took time off work and found someone to watch my son while I was gone. I went to a trauma focused residential treatment program that has a specialization in helping professionals. I received IFS, psychodrama, somatic therapy, cognitive processing therapy, among other modalities. IFS saved my life. My primary therapist continued to affirm to me that he would work with me when I returned from treatment. Towards the end of my treatment, I was really upset that he wasn't acknowledging his role in the dynamic that occurred prior to me needing a higher level of care, I acknowledged my role and I hoped he would acknowledge his role in the rupture too. He couldn't. He told me that I need to take the entire responsibility of the dynamic, which felt so dismissive of certain of certain parts inside of me. So, he told me it would be best for me to start working with someone else.

When I came back, I did some transition sessions with him and did the day group IOP for several weeks, which that newer therapist does not facilitate. Everything went well. During my first session back with him after residential, he told me that he hurt me and he's not okay with that, he didn't apologize, he didn't say what he specifically did that hurt me, he just said he wasn't okay with that. It was really difficult going to the transition sessions, as it felt like the loss of a parent, there was a lot of transference on my end. He had told me he loved me since the beginning of us working together, and we often hugged at the end of every session. There was also a lot of communication outside of the actual therapy session, which hindsight, led to more dependency rather than independency.

He really struggled with allowing my internal experiences to not dysregulate him, which he did not explicitly say but that was indicated in his behaviors and expressions of frustration towards me. Rather than figuring out more stringent boundaries, he was adamant on me beginning to work with a new therapist. This felt like a huge rejection and abandonment, which I told him. He told me I could come back work with him after I see a new therapist for a bit. I reached out to him a couple weeks ago and requested to work with him again, it definitely came from a young wounded part that believes that someday the person that caused harm will finally see me and understand me. He responded that due to the therapeutic relationship being predominantly repair and rupture, that we cannot work together. When I first started to work with him, I had nightmares he was going to abandon me, and I told him this when we started working together. His response a year ago was that he will work for me until he dies or until I fire him. Neither of those things happened.

I started working with a Sensorimotor Psychotherapist who is also trained in IFS. She has been phenomenal. Despite this, I still long for the previous therapist. I still try to wrap my head around why he did what he did, and said what he said. There is a lot more that he said and did, that is just too much to explain here. But I feel so incredibly hurt by him for not being seen, heard and understood not just on one occasion, but for months. I feel hurt that the rupture dynamic was completely blamed on me. He eventually stated he played a part but he never mentioned what specific part he played. While yes, my attach/cry for help part came up when I was extremely triggered and then I'd go into fawn, then when none of those things worked, a fight part came out. He never apologized for his specific parts he played in the dynamic. It just feels like I never got true closure for what happened. The whole situation with him feels like a retraumatization. I am absolutely grateful for my new therapist who is trained in IFS and Sensorimotor Psychotherapy, but this pain from the previous therapist continues to impact my daily life. This has caused a lot of hurt, because this is someone who was supposed to help and the first person and therapist I actually told all of my trauma to."

811,2,In the elevator. They appears to be a veteran had panic attacks and he laughs a little.
812,3,"waking up on the later side of six pm. one second i’m hiding from someone trying to kill me. room to room i hide. people i’ve lost along the way. i try blending into the blankets and other things thrown around the floor. i slower my breathing so they don’t hear me. the abandoned ruins are surprisingly quiet. they walk into the room and i can hear their footsteps. every step closer i can feel it vibrate the floorboards. boots crunching whatever is underneath. fear and mortality running through my veins. prey waiting to complete the circle of life. hunted and found. 
next minute you open your eyes in a panic. sweat dripping from your face and sticking to your back soaking the clothes you wear. for a second you wonder where you are. memories rush back and you realize you’re awake in your bed. no longer in immediate danger. although it feels like you still are. you check your phone. confused if it’s morning or night. then you realize you’re hours late for your shift at your job. real life. responsibilities. overrun by this sick fantasy you make yourself late to your only source of income. they’re tired of your problems. they all flood your mind at once. it’s nobody to blame except your own mind. the waking world and wherever you go with your eyes closed blend together seamlessly. confusing and trapping you in the never ending cycle of reality and insanity. "
813,1,"Maybe it’s partially because I live in an everyone knows everyone kind of place but I’m 17f (18very soon). Barely any friends. Everyone hates me. Because of the trauma I used to be very mentally ill. I had lots of breakdowns. I never was rude or hurt anyone I was just extremely mentally ill. 

Lots of people already didn’t like me for being weird but this gave them a “reason” to hate me. People hate me for my mental state as a 12 year old. I’ve tried moving on but everyone holds a grudge or has heard about me from places.

And recently I ran away from my parents because of my mental state and them being awful to me. They knew I was safe. They knew I just wanted to be on my own. And they said they were going to kick me out when I was 18 anyway. So I was like fuck this I’ll leave on my own. 

I didn’t go no contact. I told them what was happening. And they still decided to publicly make a post about me being “missing”. And them having “no idea” where I am. Even though the police themselves refused to make a post about it. 

So now everyone thinks I’m even more crazy than they already did. 

I want to die. There’s no way I’ll be able to have a social life after my trauma and mental health issues.

I want to die. I’m expected socially,academically,job wise to be the same level as everyone else.

Everyone just thinks this is me. But it shouldn’t be. I feel like the trauma didn’t just affect me at the time but it stole my whole life.

I used to be really happy up until 8 when the trauma happened. I struggled because I’m autistic but other than that it was all fine and I had friends and was good in school and I was always trusting of people and really kind and happy. And slowly over the years because of the original traumas and the several other traumas that have happened because my life basically never stops being traumatic my life has gotten worse and worse. "
814,2,"TW: Sexual abuse, talk of sex/orgasm

I (F) have realized recently that past sexual abuse has really messed up how I view sex in general. I don’t mind either men or women, but the times I’ve been violated sexually it’s been men. Because of this I feel like I generally avoid them, but also I’ll seek out casual sex with men in a way that feels harmful to me? 

Like I’ll hook up with a guy occasionally, knowing I don’t want anything other than that from him, but feeling like he’s just using my body to masterbate the whole time. 

Additionally the only way I’m able to orgasm is by thinking about the times I’ve been previously assaulted. I don’t know why my brain does this, but it feels like a compulsion, I don’t like it, and it leaves me feeling upset. Even if I’m with a woman, I feel this way, even though the experience is different. I don’t know if anyone else can relate to this or explain why it is happening. It disgusts me to think like this, especially if another person is involved, when I know I’d much rather be thinking of something more pleasant.

I am at a place where I’m starting to want an actual relationship with another person but feeling like my dysfunction around sex is holding me back. I can’t have another person touching me intimately without disassociating or panicking and it is so isolating. 

I have a ptsd diagnosis from an unrelated complex grief situation, but I’ve never talked to a professional about this. I am terrified to and wouldn’t know where to start. In some ways I feel at fault for the times I hooked up with men knowing it was going to hurt me, through no fault of their own. Somehow it feels like it takes away from the times I was attacked by men when I was younger. Idk. Any input is appreciated, I feel very alone in this."
815,2,"Hey so my therapist brought up PTSD the other day. Alluding to the fact that I had that. And honestly no thank you. I'm good. I could go my whole life without processing my trauma and I'd be fine. I'm good. 

I just keep getting called away from what I'm doing and like seeing old memories of sad things or even just imaginary daydreams. And I like stop seeing what's in front of me and completely see the memory or daydream and I have to fight to get myself back. That's always been a thing that happens and it fluctuated throughout my life in frequency and intensity but lately... damn... I'm really having to fight it. And today I literally felt like I was in someone else's body. Like my body wasn't my own. I was driving and I freaked out. I almost freaking pulled over on the highway.

These things have been happening more frequently and I would just like for them to stop and also not have to process through my trauma. Because honestly who cares about what happened??? It's over. It's done with. I don't care.

I don't want to have PTSD. Like I don't want that for myself. I don't want to be that person, you know? 

Like I'm strong and I have been through it but I'm resilient and I'm still here after all of it. I don't want to be like... weak you know? Like.... no thank you. I don't want that for myself. 

I'm sorry everybody. I just have not realized this is a possibility until super recently and I'm starting to recognize symptoms and I realized it's a problem I don't want to have. I already have depression and anxiety and ADHD. I'm done having things. I don't want to have another thing. 

I don't want to have PTSD. "
816,2,"I'm currently trying to finally talk in therapy about it. I told my therapist without saying the specific words. Trying to face my traumas. I just can't say it, though. I don't know why. 

I'm normally that stereotypical patient that over intellectualizes and analyzes all their behavior, so I'm extremely self aware, but struggle enormously with doing a thing about any of it. Not this. All I can feel is panic if I put any thought too it. It just feels wrong too say. I don't write it. I don't say it even to myself. I rarely even think the words.

Then i just feel broken. Like I'm irreparable. It's just a fracture in myself that can never align and heal. Tf is wrong with me? I can talk about every other fucked up thing my dad did but that one thing is just... I can't."
817,2,"Hey, I have struggled with nightmares daily due to ptsd. I recently went on duloxetine for a week before my doctor stopped it due to a concern but when I was first on it my nightmares had stopped. I wasn’t sure if it was related to the medication as duloxetine has no mention of helping with nightmares and in fact causes them in many people. Once I was taken off the medication my nightmares started again. I recently started the medication again as my doctor decided it was okay for me to be on it. My nightmares have now stopped again. It has only been a few days since I’ve been back on it but hoping it continues past the first week. Has anyone experienced this? (Posted this on r/cymbalta too haha) "
818,1,"Hello, I am a survivor of CSA. I would rather not disclose any information about myself.
In the span of a few years, my mental state went from random disturbing memories of the event to episodes where I'd feel phantom touches, smells, tastes, etc. in disturbing detail.
The event itself was when I was somewhere around 7-8 years old, but I kept it neatly locked away somewhere in my brain until I was about 11. It traces back that far, and since 11, I'm reliving it over and over in my head. 
He was a family friend, 50-something, and he did it multiple times when my parents weren't home. I didn't tell a soul until I was 14. My mother didn't receive that well, I would say she didn't even offer much support and I felt utterly alone at that moment. 
I still feel alone since then, like I have no one to truly trust, to confide in, someone who'll just listen and try to understand. It's been so tough, there was a time where I'd have these episodes every day like clockwork and it's never been more hellish. 
As of now, I don't have access to therapy, it being very expensive and potentially risky in terms of finding a good therapist.
It's been so bad that I can't look at graying old men specifically with brown eyes because in them I see him. I don't remember his face, but my brain doesn't see much of a difference, I'm terrified and feel the urge to flee whenever I see one. Every person is a potential danger to me in my head.

I am lost on what to do now. How do I cope with those resurfacing memories and how do I get my life back? How do I stop searching for that monster in every person I encounter? How do I truly understand that it wasn't my fault and forgive myself? I've been struggling for years without anyone knowing what's going on and it's like a prison. 

Thank you for listening to me, as I feel like this is the only way I can find at least a fraction of peace of mind. May true happiness find way into your life. "
819,3,"I have severe PTSD and my memory is suffering because of it. It’s to the point where it affects my everyday life like work, chores, bills, etc. I’m forgetting vocabulary words that I know. It almost takes fives seconds for each word to come out because I’m trying to remember what I just THOUGHT. The place that I work at already knows that I have this disorder but my lack of memory might make them lose their patience. My brain is constantly foggy and most of the time I’m unresponsive when someone is speaking to me because I either forgot what they said or how to speak. I’m forgetting to do my laundry and clean around the house. I forgot that I got an eyebrow piercing with a friend a week ago (yes something that would be impossible to forget) and I’m lucky that it’s not infected. There’s no other thoughts that distract me from remembering, they just come then go, Its to the point where I KNOW I forgot something, but I just let it go because it hurts to try and remember. I’m scared that it will get any worse than it already is, I don’t want to end up as an empty shell by the time I’m like 21. I’m scared to try new medication because the last ones messed me up and took me a long time to get off of them because of withdrawals. I had a therapist before and I’m trying to find a new one now, but I doubt I’ll even remember to make an appointment. I don’t know what kind and type of support I can get when it’s this bad, Ive been hospitalized because of this before but I live in a state that doesn’t take mental health seriously unfortunately."
820,0,"This question is a bit vague, sorry in advance about that. I don't have PTSD but I've been dating a guy for a few months who does, and it really affects his quality of life. I've done some research and tried to find some things could help him which I've gently shared but in a non-pushy way and he seemed pretty receptive to. He's very open about specific ways it affects him, which is helpful, even though I know he doesn't really like talking about his feelings. I guess I just wanted to know what people's thoughts were on how to be there for him without being overbearing, and whether there's anything you'd like a partner to do to help that you might not feel comfortable openly asking for? He's great, he deserves the best."
821,1,"I'll preface this by saying I'm both autistic (bands 2) and a first responder and optimism doesn't bode well in my field. Recently I've found myself to be extremely cynical in my view of the world, I can't look at my girlfriend without assuming she is disloyal, I don't believe she is disloyal yet I cannot help but ponder if she is. I look at everything as risk versus reward, I feel like I don't assume inherent altruism within people any more. Maybe I'm overthinking everything and I just need to turn my brain off and be shallow and have vapid thoughts rather than thinking too deeply about anything 
Am I cynical in part because of my PTSD or have I just developed a bitter and insecure outlook of the world?"

823,3,"One of the few things I have left on my personal list of things to accomplish is to get physically very far away from where my abusers are.

Almost everything I write is about this.


But it feels, like in order to accomplish what is most important... it truly *feels* like I have to endure yet another 18 years of torture.

824,3,"I had like 8 years of trauma related to my sexuality and privacy invasion outing me to people and disclosing information to people I wasn't ready to share. 

This trauma was exasterbated when a search warrant was executed on me because a someone gave the FBI the wrong phone number leading me to be handcuffed, shipped to an interogation room, and questioned for a few hours while police took my phone from me to get a search warrant signed off by a judge. My phone had things I thought were personal and some photos of my self I took examining an itchy spot I couldn't see without a camera that I winced about the thought of the officer seeing. 

This compounded privacy related fears to a new level and I had panic attacks related to people misunderstanding me and even having information I didn't want shared with them. 

I got put in a psychiatric hospital where I was misdiagnosed with having a psychotic episode and put on antipsychotics for 6 months which did nothing while my fam kept pushing me not to stop taking my meds which I knew did nothing. I was so insecure about a lot of it that it came out pretty incoherent since I was scared to explain it directly which probably lead to a psychosis diagnosis. 
 I failed a class and had to take an extra semester of college from this. I am taking a gap semester before I start grad school since I couldn't start in spring due to my mental health.  I got misdiagnosed with OCD in april which lead to my fam being mad at me for not taking meds which would do nothing for trauma and rational fears. I was so shocked and nervous about the misdiagnosis I couldn't talk and ask questions to explain why this was wrong and a misunderstanding of 8 years of trauma compressed into a 40 minute session. 

I want to go back to the psychiatrist now to get a better diagnosis. It made me curious if anyone here has also has experienced like this?"

She never acknowledged her actions or anything. She said she'd give me the space I wanted but I still think she'll show up at some point wanting to talk; I won't answer the door. 

It felt like I opened a window and breeze started to flow through me.

I’m tired of living with the memories popping up all the time.

I cannot concentrate (I also have adhd <3) and most of all: my memory sucks.

What I was wondering, apart from general getting medication and proper therapy, was there anything that helped you specifically get back cognitive abilities?

Before my traumas my intelligence was sharp as a knife, I saw it as my defining traits. (I was a tad bit arrogant, so I definitely got humbled by my experiences too) and now I just feel like a husk of what was before... 

Occasionally my intelligence will shine through and that will make me sad too, because it reminds me of how I was before and what I have lost?

  
So the things I have thought about that might work (if I can keep doing them, yay procrastination!) is:

1. Math Exersizes for adults (haven't been able to find many good things tho, also maths is locked behind alot of anxiety for me still :( )

2. Playing some casual games on my phone that challenge me, Sudoku, Puzzle games, Memory, etc?

3. playing challenging video games like Factorio

Honestly I suspect that mostly I am blocking myself from accessing my mental faculties properly - basically I am afraid of being smart so my psyche just locks away those parts of my brain?

Also I cannot put extremely much time and energy into it either, because I need it to finish university (which is also a whole nother thing. I just realized that maybe I am sabotaging myself from finishing uni because I am afraid of what comes after... fun times)

  
But yeah, mainly I am just interested in your experiences.

Did your cognitive abilities just get better when you got therapy for your ptsd (I mean it makes sense, worrying about everything all of the time uses up alot of your mental capacity!), or did you find things that specifically helped that aspect?"
835,2,"I think that my family is aware that I have PTSD and probably thinks Ive been aware the whole time.

I thought I was autistic alot of people treated me differently and would even say things like he had a bad childhood. The staple of my childhood is pretty much me going out getting triggered and getting laughed at by my friends and then just shutting down and hurting there feelings by purposefully saying something I know I can't take back I feel like my bodies on constant lookout for things that could potentially remind me of my trauma. Simple tasks that invoke anxiety trigger worse reactions aswell
Edit: I'm 17m and bad things happend when I was 6-14 years old my family is aware it happened i have 3 other siblings ive asked about possible autism and or PTSD and they always ask something like why would you want to have that so I just always thought if I actually did they would of told me instead they just silently ""supported"" me why'll I cried everyday wondering what's actually wrong with me and wondering why my normal state was never anybody else's

I've always been met with a dont let the past control you kinda attitude or bad things happen to good people  from my family and I just have so much shame from not being able to get over my anxiety like everybody else that I've never talked about it "
836,2,"I am a longtime archer and have been since I was very young. It’s something I love- I make my own arrows, attend club events, I’m even writing a university dissertation on the medieval longbow. The problem is in shooting itself.

A couple of years ago I faced a series of armed home invasions for over 8 nights in which a lot of people were injured- me included. One of the only ‘weapons’ I had on hand were my bow and arrows, something I was forced to use and have long since had issues about.

 I have never been diagnosed with PTSD but face a lot of struggles that are associated with it- and shooting is a big one. 

I sold my old bow, I couldn’t bring myself to shoot it anymore, and switched to a whole new bow style. It helped a bit but even now when I find myself trying to shoot, there’s a weird surge of adrenaline and something akin to panic- it’s difficult to describe. I feel like I’m back in the moment even though I rationally understand where I am and what I’m doing.

Has anyone experienced something similar to this? I really want to get back into archery- I used to shoot on a competitive level- but I find myself completely avoiding it altogether. I know it’s a unique situation but if anyone has experienced anything similar I’d be hugely grateful for any advice- thank you!

837,0,"I’m posting for both advice and so I feel less alone. 


What do you remember that helped? 


I remember looking up some of my worst symptoms and finding a post describing that experience here. There was also a comment that said something like “it’s scary but it happens to me too”.

838,3,"Hi all, I am 28F and work for a small LGBTQ Pride nonprofit organization that has been going through a lot of mismanagement issues and leadership change — our most recent Executive Director was my boss and a truly toxic person. Over the course of working for her the past 8 months, I have without a doubt developed an anxiety disorder, and our workplace is now being investigated for a hostile work environment. She was much worse to my friend/coworker who is mixed race than me, but according to my coworkers, I got her hostility second. This boss unexpectedly resigned/took a new job (to no one’s disappointment) and in her exit, fired my friend who’d she’d been most hostile to and who was my closest support system throughout all this. Without trying to get too into the logistics of how this tremendously impacts my work and our ability to respond to other crises — the combination of all these events happening in rapid succession, developing so much anxiety at work over the past 8 months under a toxic boss, losing my closest support colleague, and having a history of PTSD triggered me into having a series of anxiety/panic attacks over the course of several days. Part of my anxiety symptoms is that I have a severely decreased appetite, so I am often weak. I tried taking a weekend out of town to get my mind to clear but when I came back to work, I immediately fell back into overwhelm. I took the rest of the week off as medical leave but still haven’t been able to get myself out of this loop. My brain feels so weird and I have such a hard time with decision making. I’ve been so disoriented and my ‘usual’ methods of doing yoga, relaxing, talking to friends/family, spending time at the beach, etc. haven’t helped as much as I want them to feel confident about going back to work.

I saw my doctor who gave me Lexapro (I also take Wellbutrin, Propranolol, and have Ambien and Xanax) and my therapist explained to me the amygdala and prefrontal cortex and how they work in trauma response. I am stuck in a loop of fight flight freeze but want to get back to work (though I need to find a new job ASAP too). I’m not sure what to do to get to work tomorrow. I wish I had some MDMA since that’s been helpful for me in the past, I’m thinking I’ll do mushrooms today just to try something with my brain chemistry. I’ve lost my train of thought now, advice welcomed and appreciated."

843,3,"# i can heal if i went through a traumatic experience or two and that was a thing of the past. It's another thing when being a victim of misuse and abuse . all your life., wherever you go. Constant trauma, unfair treatment, and double standards. People constantly harassing you, instigating fights with you.  Check this out, while I'm in the middle of typing this up at this cafe right now, another worthless pig tested me. i had my phone charged in a socket and this bitch working here was picking up my phone and looking on the screen and completely violating my me and my personal shit. then she said ""who's phone is this"" i kept telling her ""aye!"" ""aye!"" from across the room and she wasn't listening. then i finally got her attention. i questioned why the she was touching my phone and meddling with it. she responded that they have a charging booth section. I walked over to it and she was coming up behind me trying to direct me about the charging station which was already self explanatory. her body language was hostile from the get go. she was all the way up in the personal space to the point where she was brushing up against me from behind so i stuck my elbow out at her to distance her from me and she got upset about me elbowing her and threatened to kick me out. How bout if you keep your distance, you wouldn't have to worry about catching this elbow. blame your fucking self for being to damn close, thus invading my personal pace. I told her i didn't care if you kick me out. but you need to respect my space. This is the bullshit i'm talking about. that's why i'm always on edge, hypervigilant. somebody wants to test my limits every single moment. every single day. i can never be at ease. i gotta be on edge at all times. My mental health has taken such a nosedive. sometimes i feel like i could just kill everybody in my path. i'm tired of having to fight back all my life. the trauma don't never stop...

844,1,"Yeah, just the title. This is just my life isn't it."
845,1,"I (17F) think I’m at the point where I cannot fix my life. I’m drunk and not the good kind like I was hoping. It’s just make me more depressed. I honestly want to die. I got drunk in the first place to forget how awful my life is but now I’m ruminating on it more.

Everyone has always hated me from a young age. Bullied,Raped,Abused,Kidnapped,even people trying to kill me. It’s fucked me up. 

Now I’m almost never sober. Angry or sad all the time. Have no friends. No boyfriend. Lonely. Genuinely not a good person. I used to be but even then people would hurt me. Funnily more than now but even now it’s too much. And it affects me WAY more now.

I had to quit college (UK) because of health issues and bullying. So I spend most of my days in bed crying alone or doing dumb shit.

I do a lot of dumb shit. Whether it be to look cool so people like me and I can fit in for once and have people believe I’m not a loser. Or to prove to myself I’m not out of control. Or to just feel good or powerful in some sort of way. Like I have free will so can do anything I want and honestly thought I was immune from concequences to my actions since the police have never done shit about the things that happened to me. So I thought I could do what eve I want and I did dumb shit but nothing as bad as what happened to me so I thought I’d be ok. But obviously I’m not. And now I’m waiting to see if I’m in legal trouble. I got arrested recently for something dumb I did. I am anxious. The date is approaching when I find out and I’m going crazy. I know I deserve it but I don’t want to face this. I’m freaking out. 

I attempted suicide recently. My friends and family are all distancing themselves from me because of it.

I want to fucking die. I’m going through a lot. Half deserved but still. I don’t want to live anymore. I don’t have control over anything. Half the reason I did dumb shit is because I WANTED control and now I don’t even have that. I hate myself so fucking much. 

My life was already over and now I’ve made it a lot worse. Is there a point where things are unfixable? That’s what it feels like."
846,3,"I have got to stop either being mad or emotional all the time because of things I’ve gone through. If I could just allow shock, anger, and acceptance to all exist at the same time, I’d be okay. 

I feel such an intense need to write on and on and on about everything I’ve been through and the complexities of it when it’s doing me no real good. I just need to let myself be calm with what I know instead of going on shame tirades or feeling like I need to be validated when I remember I was a victim. Frankly, I don’t know if there is any sadness anymore. With everything I’ve processed I feel like I’m just, like, *aggressively vindicated* idek how to describe it 

Maybe it’s a good thing idk I have ocd and cptsd so lord knows where my mind is going with this. I just need to try to let some of it go and take it as it comes before I stress myself out entirely. "
847,2,"I've been seeing my trauma therapist for over a month now and we still haven't started reprocessing my trauma. We've got two sessions next week and she said it won't be until the week after that we finally start reprocessing. We've been working on developing skills, and last week she said we would start next week, but then today she moved everything again. Is it normal for intake/skill development to take this long? She also told me she wants me to start seeing my regular therapist weekly again because she feels our sessions have been too much like talk therapy. She's never brought this up before and has always asked questions guiding it toward talk therapy. I'm a bit frustrated because I'm on a leave of absence from work for 4 weeks to deal with my PTSD, and by the time we hopefully start reprocessing I'll only have had maybe 2-3 sessions before I have to go back to work. I do have the option to extend, but my leave is unpaid and I can't afford to take more than maybe 6 weeks off in total."
848,0,"Hey everyone! My girlfriend has PTSD, and I care about her a lot. Sometimes when we’re hanging out or on a call, she gets flashbacks. I’m wondering how I can support her, both in those moments and in general.

Any tips or advice would be really appreciated.

(If it helps to know, she’s no longer in the environment that caused the trauma, she’s living in a different country now. Also because someone asked when she's having a flashback she stares blankly and starts hyperventilating and muttering , and then she tries cuddling with me or rub against me after a bit. )"
849,3,"I'm 19m with diagnosed type 2 bipolar and PTSD.

I haven't shed a tear in over two years. Not for lack of stress or bad things happening-- I just feel physically unable to.

I am on prozac, so I imagine that affects my ability to cry.

The point is, I really REALLY wish I could cry, because it's causing me to have horrible pent-up emotions. I feel stressed all the time because I can't release my emotions in any way.

Does anyone have a way to help with this? Or does anyone else have this problem?"
850,2,"Most times, when I’ve gone to people to tell them about how I got these really horrible death threats and someone died in front of me and etc they don’t believe me. They literally think I’m making it up. 

I also don’t trauma dump I normally make sure not to share my issues until the other person shares a lot about their issues. However I guess this gets me pigeonholed into the listening and consoling friend so then they think I don’t have any problems I would need even emotional support for. 

I don’t get why people are valid to talk to me about their problems but not the other way around? 

Especially these last two issues have really made things so much worse with my PTSD. I generally have a lot of awful nightmares and flashbacks and triggers, but normally I am able to get my bearings but with these sometimes it takes forever to realize where I am or what’s going on around me. 

I have no one to talk to besides my therapist too. I don’t get the cognitive dissonance of ostracizing traumatized people when they need support the most??? Now I’m scared to tell anyone any of my problems at all because it just scared everyone away and again I don’t trauma dump. I only talk about things after a while and after they’ve already opened up about things. "

Straight to the point, I'm wondering what the best way for me to react is when my partner gets the 1000 yard stare. I usually react quietly, hold him when he starts to cry, etc. I listen to him if he speaks. If he hears a loud bang in public, I reassure him that everything is okay. 

The thing is, I don't know if I'm handling it right. He says that how I react with calmness helps, but is there anything that you guys recommend that really helps you when you experience it? "

855,2,"Feel terrible- I feel so gross and anxious about this everyday because I can’t move on


I feel anxious every day. And Just feeling really gross about the whole situation and stuck over analyzing the whole thing. 
I just started with a new therapist, and it’s been years since I’ve been in therapy. So far, I’ve only talked about little things—stuff that’s happened during the week or practical things—but I really want to go deeper. I just feel scared and embarrassed to bring up the real stuff. I’ve been in an abusive relationship, and it’s so hard to say that out loud. This whole thing makes me feel like I’m going crazy.

I feel stuck—trapped in one way of thinking. I don’t trust people easily, and I keep reaching out to him and seeing him, even though I know it’s not good for me. A big part of me doesn’t want to start over.

Lately, I feel so disconnected from everything. Numb, anxious, like I’m just floating in my own head. I replay moments again and again, trying to make sense of them. I saw him again recently, and now I just feel stupid. I had ended the relationship months ago and was starting to feel okay. But now it feels like I’m being pulled back in.

We were together for five years. And even though there were good moments, there were also so many times I felt scared, powerless, and completely alone. Things would seem fine, then something awful would happen—and afterward, it was like it had never happened. I started questioning my own memory, my own reality.

I think I’ve been avoiding saying this, but I’m starting to realize the relationship was abusive. And now I’m stuck in this painful place where I feel conflicted. I don’t want to ruin his life. He has nothing—no money, no stability, serious mental health issues. But at the same time, what happened hurt me deeply. And I can’t pretend it didn’t.

His family ignores or excuses what he does. When I try to talk about it, I feel gaslit—not just by him, but by them too. It makes me question myself.

Here are some of the things I remember clearly:
	•	One time, I was crying and he slapped me across the face. The more I cried, the angrier he got.
	•	He once pushed me into a towel rack and dented it because I accidentally tossed his pants and they hit his face.
	•	He tried to force me to drink shroom tea. When I refused, he shoved it toward me until it spilled, then slapped me and called me a “stupid bitch.” He said I was the problem and called me a we*.
	•	He stormed into my apartment after drinking, screaming that I abandoned him. He threw my things around, ripped my shirt off, and physically restrained me. My roommate had to kick him out.
	•	The first time he grabbed my neck, I was half-naked. Afterward, I had to do a Zoom meeting with a scratchy voice. When I brought it up, he claimed it was sexual and said I was exaggerating.
	•	He would refuse to drive me to work unless we had sex. If I cried or was late, he’d threaten not to take me.
	•	During sex, if he was frustrated or couldn’t get aroused, he’d pinch me, pull my hair, and call me names. He’d accuse me of cheating or being a “bitch.”
	•	Once, he climbed on top of me and hit me in the head several times because I accidentally hit his eye with his pants.
	•	He drove erratically, pulling my hair and saying we’d both die because I talked about leaving. I had a full-blown panic attack.
	•	He choked me—multiple times. Not for long, but enough to terrify me.
	•	He wouldn’t let me go to the bathroom during sex. Even when I was crying, he wouldn’t let me stop.
	•	His cousin once overheard me crying during a fight and came in. He got even angrier and blamed me for someone seeing me like that.
	•	When his brother was staying in the same room, he made me have sex with him in the bathroom. I felt humiliated but didn’t know how to say no.
	•	He used to “inspect” me to check if I’d been with anyone else, while he himself was cheating.
	•	Once, he bit my face in anger and held me down, poking me in the chest while I cried.
	•	I believe, early in our relationship, he may have done something sexual to me while I was half asleep after getting high. It’s blurry, but it still haunts me.
	•	If I said something hurt or I didn’t want to continue during sex, he’d make fun of me, say I was lying, or keep going.
	•	He called me a sl*, a we*, a cheater—just for wanting to see my friends or family. Meanwhile, he was the one lying and cheating.

I hate admitting this, but sometimes I gave in to sex because I was afraid of what he’d do if I said no. I’d cry during or after and feel like my body didn’t belong to me anymore. Sometimes he wouldn’t let me get dressed or would make me stay in certain positions until he was ready.

One time, neighbors heard me crying and him yelling. He was throwing things, screaming threats through the wall, calling them w****s, saying he’d kill them. Later, he blamed me for everything.

So why do I still feel conflicted?

He has trauma. Mental health issues. A part of me still wants him to be okay. But none of that justifies what he did.

Does this count as abuse?
Is it sexual assault if I was crying, saying I didn’t want to keep going, and he didn’t let me stop?

I feel like I’m going crazy trying to make sense of it all. And even now, I feel guilty. I can’t bring myself to report anything—he’s already lost everything. He’s homeless because I left. But I’m still carrying all of this pain, and I don’t know what to do with it."
856,3,"I had a full dissociative breakdown today. I’ve been doing ketamine therapy, and I think something had been building. My partner and I got into a huge argument last night, and today I just felt less and less in my body. I was shaking a bit at lunch, so I had him drive us home from the cabin. By the time we got home, I was fully numb.

I tried to push myself to go to the gym. I asked him to make me pre-workout, but I just sat there with my gym playlist blasting and didn’t move. I cried. I stopped. I realized I might need to be hospitalized.

I wrote a message to my mom: “Sorry I’m missing Mother’s Day. I’ll be at the hospital. Safe.” Then my hands wouldn’t stop shaking. If I flexed every muscle at once, I could stop it for a second, but it would start again right after. I couldn’t breathe right. I couldn’t ground.

Eventually, he noticed, came over, and helped me breathe. He was about to take me in or call 911. I forced myself to flex everything and hold still until it hurt, and that’s when I finally found some stillness.

I already texted my therapist this morning to set up an appointment first thing Monday. Just needed to get this out."
857,2,"My current partner said something that quite heavily triggered me from a previous relationship, of course it wasn’t on purpose, neither of us knew it was a trigger but it definitely was.

It felt like I was completely frozen in place, I couldn’t breathe, my whole body was shaking and I felt like I was out of body. It was so extreme to a point I had never felt before, like I hadn’t felt it that strong.

The after effects are still lingering, my body hurts so much and my head keeps pulsing and I feel so tired. Like how tf is this such a strong and physical reaction."
858,2,"(I'm not sure if I've ptsd or not)
(Throwaway for obvious reasons)

I had a breakup around 1.5 years back.
Me and my ex we dated for a short while, but there's something which affected me a lot.

My ex coerced into having physical intimacies with him and after having done the said things, he dumped me cold within very few days. (He persuaded me for a long time, made a lot of promises and once we did it, he started acting wierd and would pick up fights, then broke up on the same pretext)

He broke up with me giving very stupid reasons, when I tried to reason, he would say that we won't work out, we aren't compatible etc. I tried very hard to save that relationship, but he blocked me after dumping me.

It was painful and heartbreaking.

I gained a lot of weight and developed anxiety issues, however gradually I tried to turn my life around and tried to get better

And touchwood, I'm genuinely doing a lot better in my studies and hitting gym as of now as well as meeting new people. But I don't know why there's always a pensive sadness within me.

Whenever I watch a movie with intimate scenes, I get triggers and have anxiety attacks. My ex did block me everywhere, but I got to know that he's leaving the country this month and thinking about it makes me anxious knowing the breakup didn't affect him as much as it did to me and he's thriving, whereas it took me a lot of efforts to even feel normal

Actually, everything about him makes me anxious. I want to move on and find someone better but I feel a lot of shame, guilt and anxiety. 

How can I move on? 
(I don't have access to therapy right now, so please help your girl out)"
859,2,"It was the most normal day, beautiful out, windows down and music playing. I was heading to lunch since I usually forget to pack my own. I was traveling up a steep hill when I heard a motorcyclist throttling his engine at a high rate of speed. Very dangerous road. Before I could even blink he was approaching me and what seemed like he was trying to pass me over a double yellow line, but there was a car coming over the hill that the man couldn’t see, or he just didn’t give himself enough room to get around me.

He collided with my rear end at such a high speed. I looked in my mirror and saw the man fall into the opposite lane of traffic and get run over by a car going in the opposite direction. The car could not stop in time before it struck him, horrifically. I turned my car around as fast as I could and called 911 simultaneously. Ran to the motorcyclist who was in the fetal position on the ground (with a helmet) and checked his pulse, with no feeling. No breathing signs on his stomach.

I along with others sat with him until paramedics and police arrived, but he was gone. My boss from work showed up, and the motorcyclists boss did too, because we actually work in the same building. I’ll never forget the young man’s eyes. I can see them looking at me when I close my eyes. The moment replays in my head it seems like every hour of every day. The young man who struck the motorcyclist was obviously completely distraught as well as everyone on scene including myself.

Going back to work and possibly encountering that road again terrifies me. Anytime I have any free time, or when I’m laying in bed, this occupies my entire mind space, so I haven’t slept a full night in a couple days. I hope that the grievance counselors at my job will help whenever I decide to go back."
860,0,"No this is not a TBI miracle cure but can treat symptoms of TBI. The biggest relief a TBI sufferer will get immediately from a ibogaine treatment is the immediate reduced inflammation in the brain. Inflammation exists in all injuries but inflammation of the brain is complicated by the hard skull. The brain has no room to expand due to inflammation. Ibogaine will reduce swelling immediately.

The next thing that occurs is neural plasticity which is mode your brain goes into to repair itself. Neuralplasticity allows the neurons to reconnect and grow. In cases like TBI you have damaged parts of the brain that may be unusable. The neurons will grow around the damaged creating new connections and optimizing how the brain delivers seratonin and dopamine. 

It is important to understand ibogaine treats symptoms of TBI but is not a cure. It will allow the brain to operate more efficiently with the damage but will not cure the damage. 

Ibogaine however does cure some of the side effects especially around mental health like depression and anxiety. 

TBI injury and the severely damaged parts of the brain will remain damaged, it simply helps every thing around it work more efficiently. So if you are looking for relief of certain symptoms I would recommend you research ibogaine and see if it is for you. Unfortunately as of today there is no cure for TBI but ibogaine is available for some of the worst symptoms. "
861,0,"I have PTSD-induced insomnia and took my first dose of prazosin today. 1mg. 

I can’t remember feeling THIS relaxed in ages. I’m 3 hours into my 1st dose and now feel my muscle tension leaving. My heart feels better, like for once it isn’t beating out of my chest. 

For the last 3 years, I’ve tried everything. All meds, antidepressants, you name it. This is the feeling I achieved only through 3+ hours of consecutive meditation. I like meditating, but it felt like excessive time spent for the desired effect. My breathing is nice and slow without practicing mindfulness. 

This is a game-changer. Call me smitten if I can finally release my hyper-vigilance and not take ANY psychotropic medication to do so. 

The jury is still out on sleep, but I can already tell this will be essential in my trauma toolbox. 

"
862,0,There are nerves inside and behind it that are involved with the limbic system and therefore our parasympathetic nervous systems. Massaging the muscle will innervate the nerves and send signals to our limbic systems which in turn will put us back in to a calm rested state. This state is what we need active to come out of PTSD. Do it as often as you wish. It will only calm and sooth you. Good luck.
863,2,"I read that people with autism experience things as traumatic that others wouldn’t. Does anyone agree or have evidence, personal stories, or more information about this? For example, I get overstimulated by big groups of people making a lot of crowd noise and this makes me have meltdowns - I go into flight or fight or freeze or fawn reaction. This has led to lots of embarrassing social situations that most people probably would not be bothered by. (I just self-tested high chance for autism last fall.) Autistic people are also more likely to be bullied even in innocent or harmless situations because people tend to notice we are socially divergent and find that threatening even for no apparent reason. And we can just be more intense about certain emotions in general. 

I have PTSD relating most specifically to one workplace situation. If I had trusted my social intuition more I would have seen the toxicity and abuse more clearly from the beginning, but because I doubted myself and nobody understood me, I just tried to ignore and wait out an abusive situation until it blew up in everyone’s face. I learned years later that autistic people are bad at sensing danger as we have less of a sense of it, or are more people pleasing and sometimes ignore a sense of danger from other people. 

Another thing that contributed to this for me is increased pattern recognition. Because autistic people are better at recognizing habits and seeing things coming before they happen, I always complained about problems as a kid growing up, people ignore me because I’m “weird” and then when they happen, people are so embarrassed that I called it out beforehand they don’t want to admit I embarrassed them so instead of apologizing for ignoring me, they get intimidated by me and try to embarrass me back.

Does anyone else relate to this or have any useful information about it?"
864,1,"How often do you think of self harming yourself to get rid of the mental torture for not able to control your life and emotion to give yourself a better life that you deserve. I have been feeling like i am living as a dead soul being alive in this world. Sometimes i even thought of suicide or taking my own life but the next moment when i realize there are people who will suffer due to my death who have raised me, they did not raise me to take my life because of some stupid shit has taken over my life. If you have to choose between living a life a normal human being that you used be before the trauma hits to you by the closest person you love you or live like a dead soul to adjust with the life that is imposed on you do?"
865,2,"Hi. I don’t really know how to start this, but I need to get it out somewhere because I feel like I’m falling apart.

A few days ago, my small dog was violently attacked by a much larger dog in an unprovoked assault. I was picking up her poop and she was calmly sitting next to me, then suddenly, this huge dog came charging. It had gotten off leash or atleast the one walking the dog lost control the dog.

I somehow (thankfully) managed to force the dog’s mouth open and get her out while screaming for help. The other owner did almost nothing. I got her free as safe as i could and rushed her to the vet (the vet was only 500-700m away, which is probably the only reason shes still alive and that i knew exactly where to go). She had serious internal injuries and needed emergency surgery. The first 48 hours were very critical and it felt like an eternity.... (my dog is around 12 lbs and the attacking dog was atleast 100 lbs probably closer to my own weight...) 

She survived and she’s home now. And don’t get me wrong, I’m beyond grateful and overjoyed that she’s with me again. I love her more than I can put into words. But I’m still terrified. I’m worried constantly during her recovery. Every time she breathes weird or moves too suddenly, my heart jumps, but I try to keep calm around her to not stress her, she's a very brave and strong little dog but I can see on her how anxious she gets yet she is way calmer than I imagend possible after which makes me happy. It's been 2-3 weeks now since so everything isn't 100% over, but when she got home she started wagging her tail at me and showing me so much unconditional love (I was so afraid she was gonna hate me afterwards)

I’ve reported everything to the police. I have witnesses etc. But now I can't get a hold of the ""attacker"" but I have their info so I hope the police can reach them...I’ve been told “lots of these cases get dropped.” Like it’s nothing. But it’s everything to me, so i hope with all evidence and such it doesnt. I’ve also spoken to a therapist. I’m doing all the “right” things. But I still can’t sleep. I wake up in panic, seeing it happen all over again. My body and mind won’t let it go.

People around me don’t understand. They say I should be okay now that she’s okay. But I’m not. I’m still in it.

And worst of all, I can’t stop blaming myself. I know it wasn’t my fault, but I keep thinking “what if I had moved faster, what if I had seen it coming?” That loop won’t stop. And I'm waking up everyother hour drenched in sweat and during day time I try to care for her which keeps my mind abit at easy. (Without disturbing her rest ofc) 

I’m not looking for advice. I just needed to say this somewhere. To people who get what it’s like to love so hard and feel so helpless. If you’re out there, thank you for reading.

(Also, I’m sorry.. I should’ve mentioned earlier that I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD before this, and this event just spiraled everything. If this post feels out of place here, I truly didn’t mean any harm. I just needed somewhere safe to talk.❤️)"
866,1,"I was diagnosed 8 years ago. The last 8 months have been hell and for the first time I really feel like I really *really* have ptsd. I’ve experienced every symptom except night terrors and I’m shutting down. Nothing that used to work works now, usually it makes things worse. I don’t have a great support system. Not suicidal. I just. Feel like I’m slipping away. I don’t know what to do. Considering going to the hospital, but that’s never really been helpful. I’ve gone through so many types of treatment. I’m just…lost. Scared. Exhausted. "
867,1,"Recently diagnosed, and finally getting some much needed therapy. I very much tend to bury my emotions, and analyze them rather than feeling them (which is something I'm working on). Because of this, I come across as very stoic, bordering on nonchalant. 

I was in my third session with my new  individual therapist, just starting to touch on some of the things I went through, nothing specific, just generational trauma, family relations, etc. and while I forget how exactly she worded it, she was basically saying how much of our personalities, Ideas about ourselves, and perseptions of communications with others are starting to form around the ages of 5-7 years old. She asked what type of child I was, if I was the loud, out going, temper tantrum child, or the more reserved, quiet, bookworm. 


I explained to her that it was a running joke in my family, not even just immediate family, but extended family that visited for holidays as well, that I was never a child, just a tiny adult. That by that age I was already cooking, cleaning, reading at a very advanced level, etc; and that one of my earliest memories of my mother was the abuse I had already suffered by her at the age of 4-5. 


Y'all, this woman started crying. She didn't even say anything for a couple minutes, just sat nodding, writing something down and wiping her eyes. She finally asked me if I really thought it was a joke, and I explained that now as an adult I know it wasn't normal, but that at the time everyone in the family honestly made a joke of it. It was quite literally laughed about. That they had never seen someone my age so well mannered, well spoken, that my mother never had a baby she just gave birth to a 20 year old midgit (yes, I know it can be offensive, this was the early '90s and the actual wording used) and lied to everyone. I didn't really play, explore, or socialize, I just cooked, cleaned, read books, and maybe crocheted or knitted with my Grams when I could. They joked that I was an 80 year old woman trapped in a 6 year old body. 


""No one ever asked why?"" No, they all boasted, acted like I was some sort of progeny. I didn't mind at the time because I loved to read, and it meant I got a lot of books and new clothes for holidays. ""You got excited for new clothes? Did you ever get...toys? Games?"" Not really? Maybe one here and there, but even things I viewed as a 'toy' at the time really wasn't, like the one year my uncle brought me a genuine handmade cactus rain stick from Arizona. I played with it like a toy until my mother got irritated with the noise and took it. I still have it now though, but I realized how special it was and it's on display now. 


I'm not sure if my therapist wanted to hug me or shake me honestly. It wasn't until after the session that I realized where she was going with all of that. How disconnected I am from it all, and how much I avoid actually thinking about it with what I know now. I kinda dread what her reaction will be once we start the actual trauma work, once I'm comfortable enough to open up about the more extreme abuse. There was a point in time I would have said ""the actual abuse"" because it's hard to reconcile that this was all a part of it as well. That the lens of perfectionism combined with the violence systematically trained me into what I became. 

How do you cope with the 'lesser offences'? The things that still contributed to your trauma, but weren't necessarily a part of the main event so to speak? In a way things like this are harder for me, because I have very little active memory of the worst parts, so the things leading up to and after seem more vivid. "
868,2,"Went in by prosecutors order, made by my own parents, for cannabis use.  
I was a chatty, generally happy individual, had my intrests, my hobbies, my friends.  
One day two police officers, arrive at my door, and put me in handcuffs. They drag me to the police station, where my parents file some legal papers. Keep in mind, i'm an adult. So, they lied, saying i had a psychotic episode, just to get me in a mental asylum, to get me clean of off cannabis. So, as soon as i arrive at the asylum, the nurses strap me on to a bed, and procceed to tie my hands and legs with belts on to a bed. Keep in mind that i was not violent, i was scared, i wasn't talking, i wasn't even aware of what the hell was going on.  
I spent 3 days on that bed, strapped with belts, till i pissed on myself. I was only given water.  
I was constantly being injected with heavy doses of midazolam diazepam and biperiden.  
After those 3 days i was untied, only to see that someone had stolen all my clothes and personal items.  
Thank god i didnt have any important documents/cards/phone on me, as they were not allowed.  
I contacted my parents, letting my anger aside, they brought me some clothes, and my vape.  
The nurses were constantly screaming at us, treating us like thrash, the doctors saw us for 5 min sessions in which they practically didnt let you speak and just forced their opinion on you. There was no differentiation between patients, meaning violent dangerous ppl were in there with us. (And that will play a crucial role)  
I stayed in there 3 monthes, they gave me so much olanzapine (Zyprexa) an antipsychotic that turns you in to a freaking plant. My jaw was hanging open, saliva was pouring out, i couldnt even speak properly, i was like the walking dead. 3 months of torture, and each day i felt i was losing a piece of myself.  
After i was released, i couldnt speak for 1 month. I could only reply with yes, or no.  
So my psychiatrist prescribed me with ->

Alprazolam (Xanax), 2mg Morning 2mg Night  
Sertraline (Zoloft) 100mg Morning  
Bupropion (Wellbutrin) 300mg Morning  
Topiramate (Topamac) 100mg Morning 100mg Night  
Methylphenidate (Ritalin) 20mg Morning 20mg Afternoon  
Biperiden (Akineton) 2mg Morning 2mg Noon 2 mg Afternoon 2mg Night  
Olanzapine (Zyprexa) 5mg (extended release) Morning 5mg Night (extended release)  
Lamictal (Lamotrigine) 100mg Morning 100mg Night

So, i went in for cannabis use.  
Now i take all these psychiatric medication to deal with the fallout of the experience ive been through in that hellhole. And sadly ive become addicted to alprazolam (xanax) and methylphenidate.(ritalin)  
Yet still, if i smell certain smells or see something that remindes me of that place i get a panic attack.  
I go pale, i get tachycardia, my breathing goes shallow, my fingers are tingling and i get nausea.  
And worst of all, i can't function, i can't find a job. I'm a mess. I'm having nightmares that im still in that place and wake up with cold sweat. I have intrusive thoughts about what i went through and witnessed in there. And im feeling im losing my grip on reality. Oh... and remember when i mentioned that they didn't differentiate about violent serious cases and milder ones? So, its been 4 months since i got out, and im watching tv, and i see a story about that institution. So i turn up the volume and listen. Turns out, the police had dropped a dude who had just 2 hours ago, murdered his mother, at that very same ""hospital"" i was in. Yet, unlike me, he wasnt strapped to a bed. Rather he was left roaming freely on the grounds of the asylum. So what did that deranged person do? Punched a mirror, picked up a shard of glass, wrapped one side in cloth, and literally, approached a 44 y old woman, who was a patient too, and cut her fucking throat open. She died in minutes. If you dont believe me, i can send you a link, though its in greek, since im from Greece and you can translate it if you so wish to.. So yea, what did the mental asylum do to me?  
  
Broke my soul   
Got me on a shitload of medication  
Caused Depression  
Gave me generalized anxiety disorder  
Made me an addict to benzos and stimulants  
Left me as hollow shell of my previous self  
And gave me PTSD

If you read so far, Thanks. That's my story, and my burden to carry. I just wanted to tell someone, because i really dont know who to turn to. Thanks and, Stay on top of things."
869,2,"Like I have wonderful friends who I love so much and I think genuinely like me, but I always feel like our friendships are temporary and I'm afraid to emotionally invest myself in the people I love so much because I feel like they're just gonna turn against me. 

I know this isn't true because these friendships have lasted years already, but one of my traumatic events involved a chunk of friends turning on me and unjustly publicly slandering me after my boss got arrested. 

I dunno, I'm just scared to love my friends because I'm afraid I'm secretly an awful person and a narcissist and they'll all eventually come to hate me. "
870,2,"I went to Atlanta to spend a few days with a friend. On one of the days she was working, I decided to go over to the lake on the other side of her gated community. Now, this is still within her gated community, but the apartments were just on the other side. Near the lake was a swing where I sat there alone and just swung, looking over at the geese, the sky, and honestly, I was in pure bliss. It was radiating and was just there for sure.

A guy was over on my left side with a fishing pole in the lake. I just glanced and kept enjoying my blissful moment. I'm texting on my phone and swinging, and he walks past me. We make eye contact for a good few seconds, about 5 seconds, and then he walks past me. I don’t know where he went, didn't pay attention, didn't care. 

About 15 minutes later, he came up to me and asked me if he could have my Instagram. I give it to him and he follows me. He then asks me if I live over here, and I told him that I'm staying with a friend. He asked me if I'm from Atlanta, and I said no, I'm from New York. He states that he's from there too and lives in the Bronx. We're talking about New York, and he's giving me things to do while I'm in Atlanta. I believe he saw me take an edible because he asked me if I was feeling it yet, and I said no. He went in for a hug, and I hugged him while I stayed seated, too. I shouldn't have done that. But his arms were already reaching towards me. I knew this man all but 10 minutes at this moment. He says he'll let me go because he doesn't want to bother me anymore and left. 

About another 20 minutes later, he came back again. This time, he asked me if I wanted to come upstairs with him. I told him, ""Oh no, definitely not."" So he decides to sit next to me on the swing after a minute or two of talking, and he puts his leg on my thigh. Close enough to where he was close to touching my private area. I was spooked at first and did nothing, but then he started to rub my inner thigh, and I moved his hand. I moved it and said, ""What are you doing?"" He then says,""My bad."" Atp, I'm still sitting there, but I'm looking off to the side. There was no one else around. No cars, no apartments, no people. The only thing behind us were trees that were deep into the woods and in front of us was a lake. He asked me again, ""Did my edible kick in?"" I said not yet. And then he continued to speak. Eventually, he got up from the swing. I should add that the whole time, he never made eye contact with me. He just fumbled around with a string on his fishing pole. I asked him if he lived in this community, and he told me no. This is a gated community. 

After asking me if my edible kicked in again and got up from the swing, I looked up and saw he had taken out a knife. It was random, and I was confused. He then says, ""Damn, this knife is sharp. I just cut my finger."" At this point, I'm frozen. I break out of it and say, ""I wonder if my friend is done with work."" I started immediately texting her and said I was going to call her. At that point, he stayed for just 2 minutes afterward and then said he was going to go. He left and headed towards the exit of the community. 

When my friend came, we went to the management who told me that he was not supposed to be fishing and my friend told me there actually is no fish in that lake. The office was supposed to call the courtesy officer, who they said is a police officer, and they never got back to me or my friend to file a report. 

I still feel this man's hand on my thigh no matter how many times I shower or try not to think about it. I keep asking myself why I was so nice and engaged with him. Why did I give him my Instagram? Now he knows my account even though I blocked him. What if this guy really does live in New York where I live? Then I question if I'm overreacting, and maybe this wasn't meant to be how I thought it was. But I feel violated. I feel his hand squeezing my thigh. His Instagram has no photos of himself, just one video. 

I wasn't dressed in any provocative way. I even had a long sleeve shirt. Was he scoping me out? I'm just really confused about everything. My friend said that he came back and she got his license plate. She said he doesn't live in that community. Where was he going to take me? If I was to say sure, let's walk around and hang out and agree to go ""upstairs"" with him ... if he didn't live in that community. 

I'm supposed to have a date on Sunday and I don't even think I want to go or get to know any guy anymore. I was raped 14 years ago and it took me sometime to move on from that. However, I still had sex. Still dated. But after this incident, I just feel so sick to the point I keep thinking about why did this happened to me and what ifs are just running through my head. "
871,2,"i'm not gonna get into detail, but i went through shit. definitely traumatic, no idea if i have ptsd but since me and other people find it relevant i felt like asking here.

i can't help but find myself thinking about everything that had happened when i'm not occupied (AKA just putting everything away and attempting to just SLEEP.), so i tend to distract myself until i fall asleep. i'm tired, i don't want to be awake till 6AM again, i barely had any sleep for the past two nights and it's really late right now. Don't know what to do. You guys got any advice? thanks, much love."
872,2,"To add in some context, I used to live in an apartment complex with a sibling who wanted to kill me, had a plan for it, and would've acted it out if they weren't scared of getting caught. This lasted for about 3 or 4 years straight and I lived in constant fear as I shared a room with them and we were in the same house all day everyday. My dad didn't know at all (doubt he could've with work) and so everytime I had a nightmare about knives or was too scared to sleep, I went to my dad to see if I could sleep with him (I was 7-10 at the time) and every time after I turned 8, he turned me away and I always ended up crying to sleep while my sibling screamed at me to shut up and go to bed already.
During that time, my sibling didn't know I knew that I was in danger so they kept playing with knives, sometimes staring at me so intensely that I could feel their eyes and where they wanted to stab me.

Now after we moved out of those apartments, my sibling got better about it and stopped playing with knives and screaming at me constantly. I didn't have any nightmares, night terrors, wet beds or any of that, I just had that fear lingering onto me about knives and my sibling.

I've been diagnosed with PTSD for about a year now and have only once had full blown shut downs that have caused me to stop functioning over the most stupidest of things like a video showing off a knife, the clock ticking in class, or someone screaming far away from me. That lasted for about 5 days straight and had only 1-2 hour breaks in between each one. This has never ever happened to me before even when my sibling shoves a knife in my face acting like they're about to stab me (in a playful, joking way), that's only freaked me out for like 10 minutes then went away. It's never been where I feel like I'm back in those apartments, feeling hunted and horrifying that I'm gonna die in my sleep.

To those that have PTSD, do you think I have it? I'm starting to doubt my diagnosis from my therapist since I've never had any of the obvious symptoms and only the ""minor"" ones."
873,2,"Hello! I (18f) have had my fair share of problems with my parents, and with just life in general. It’s been about 2 or 3 years since I’ve gone through the last traumatic thing that happened. I was constantly dealing with homelessness, being split up from my sisters by family, watching my parents fight so physical I thought one parent or the other was dead… or gonna get killed… it’s been a lot, and of course, since constantly going through these things since I was 9 up until 3 years ago… I’ve showed definite symptoms of PTSD, from the nightmares, flashbacks from little smells or sights of things, to not even being able to drive past the road we lived off of. Of course, I’m not here to self diagnose, but I also don’t know where to start to get help. Since I’ve come from my situation in living in a hotel to living with a friend, my anger issues have become so severe. I feel like I’m constantly on edge, even if nothing happened, every little thing is enough to throw off my whole balance and I’m ready to punch something or yell. It was bad before from said previous experiences, but it’s worse now that I’m not around it anymore. When I’m happy, I never am actually happy, I’m just neutral, but when I’m angry or sad, I’m over the limit. Is this part of what COULD be ptsd? Or am I crazy? And where do I start? It’s so exhausting. It’s like this every day, and I hate it… but what do I expect? "
874,1,"I'm on an 8 day deployment to the desert due to unprecedented level's of flooding and I've had to temporarily stop taking my meds because they make me drowsy in the morning. Since I've stopped taking the meds withdrawal kicked in quickly and I got over that no issue, but now the feelings are starting to hit again, I'm becoming more and more insecure, paranoid and depressed, I can't sleep at night again and everything is a nightmare, I can't eat or socialise, and the impending sense of doom I had has just hit all again. I feel awful, truly awful. I regret going on this deployment every minute and it was a fools errand. Does anyone else get that sense of doom feeling and the associated insecurity and paranoia?"
875,3,"My ex (27M) and I (24F) broke up r recently but the scarring of the events that happened are deeper than ever.

There were many red flags that occurred (like him still keeping stuff from his ex, still keeping in contact with her, not telling me they dated when I was [then] close friends with her) Frankly I don’t remember much of what happened since I’ve been suppressing it a lot but I just wanted to reach out and get some insight.

He hangout with friends who absolutely despised me and they would talk mad shit about me. At one point, he accused me of stealing $1K and apparently had it all on camera when I went to stay at his house. To be clear, I did not. In the end, he blackmailed me and made me send him more than $1K and threatened to “ruin my reputation” ; I caved because i got tired of the arguing. He claims that I went through his personal belongings and etc. Later also accused me of hiding his passport and whatever and taking more of his money. He also started accusing me of taking random shit in his house whenever I would stay over. He also threatened to sue me. When we broke up, our mutual friends (around 20 of them) basically disappeared with him. I figured it was okay since I wouldn’t want to be friends with people who think I could do such a thing, you know. Later after we broke up, his drug dealer best friend threatened to take my life.

Worse of all, he drugged me. I’m not sure what it was (it was an illegal substance of some sort), and he claimed it was melatonin, but I’m on my own psych meds and it clashed horribly to a point where I had a seizure. Yes, he drives me around and it is nice but his actions are so damn filthy. He can’t get out of his bed on time for when we plan to go hangout outside and ends up punching the wall a few centimeters from my face. He critically marginalizes me based on my mental health. Just because I take meds. He and his friends are “scared for him” to have a girlfriend that might act violently against him. I’ve never acted violently because of my mental state, ever.

The money thing is big though. He went on and drilled me emotionally, like he would go so far as saying that I have a spending problem which is why I don’t have money hence I’m stealing from him, saying I have no friends because I keep shifting my social circle around (god forbid a girl knows her value and leaves when her boundaries are broken wtf)

His mom is really sweet, but is a complete pushover. She clean his room for him, does everything for him etc. I was explicitly telling her that he does drugs, and she literally shrugged it off!

He and his older sister are ridiculously spoiled, like his sister is some idol or something and lives in her own apartment but has their mom drive her laundry back to their house to wash and send back to her [the sister’s] apartment. He does drugs, smokes all kinds of nasty things.

I’m having a hard time releasing myself from this depiction of me. Now i have random people on earth who think I’m some sort of burglar. I’m seeking any sort of perspective on this. What are some suggestions? Thanks"
876,2,"(Before anyone comments, trauma does NOT excuse being a shitty person and hurting people)

!!!!!TW!!!!

Hi everyone. I’m f19 and recently got out of a relationship with my ex (m38) I was with for several months. I’ve been working through complex trauma from childhood abuse, sex trafficking, and the sudden loss of my sister. I’m in trauma therapy (TF-CBT and exposure therapy), and I know I have intense symptoms—anxiety, attachment issues, and shutting down and needing some space during emotional overload.

In the beginning, the relationship felt like everything I’d been missing. For the first two months, he was incredibly supportive. He helped me set boundaries with my toxic mom at home, made his home feel like a safe space for me and eventually let me stay with him to get out of my toxic household, and gave me structure I’d never had. He really showed up for me at a time I felt completely alone. I knew he had his little quirks about him that would typically be considered toxic, like how he'd get really upset if i couldnt answer the phone and would text him instead of calling him back. Hes opened up to me about his past and how hes struggled with addiction and dealing with toxic exes in the past. So i understood why he has the mindset that he does when it comes to respect and stuff. I knew that everything he told me made him feel disrespected was valid, i just think that even though i understand why he was harsh, he didnt understand why id react or behave the way i do. He would feel like i was hiding stuff whenever he would ask me questions and stuff but because ive been struggling with pretty bad cognitve delay and speech processing, it takes me a second to think and even respond sometimes, and its not just him that im like that with. Those were the biggest things that made me ""lose his trust"". And he kept telling me that all i have to do is correct my behavior but im not. When he lost his job at the end of March, I gave him $2,000 to help with bills last month he asked for it after one of our fights because he said that would include car rides when i need to go somewhere, utilities, and he also added my phone to his phone plan bevause it was 10$ more rather then me paying 70$ a month.  he genuinely was struggling and I truly wanted to give back for everything he had done for me at that point anyways so it made me feel like i was helping him out for once. 

He watches narcissist/abuse videos often, and I felt like he was starting to see me only through that lens. I tried to tell him I was aware of my patterns (i dont think im a terrible person but i felt like i had to constantly ""take accountability"" and just accept that thats what he thinks) and actively trying to grow—going to therapy, practicing yoga, being more mindful—but he said that made it even worse because it means I “know better” and still act this way.

 as the weeks went on (ive had to recently revisit my trauma with being trafficked after hearing about a progression in the case) and i guess my symptoms showed up more like shutting down in hard conversations, avoiding conflict out of fear, or being emotionally reactive when I felt like he wasnt understanding the complexity of my symptoms—he started calling me manipulative, emotionless, and toxic. He’d tell me I only do things to get a reaction out of people, even negative ones. He said people like me don’t change, that we only feel sorry once we’ve lost something.

We called yesterday for the last time and he said that maybe in the future him and i couls be friends but he doesnt want toxicity in his life and the call just didnt end well really, i didnt feel anything inside, there was nothing i can say orndo inside. He just kept going on and on about how people like me lie to themselves and surround themselves with people who lie to them, in the end i still tried to stick up for myself a little bit without excusing how ive came across as toxic the past 2 weeks, and he just hung up. 

I'm trying to move on because I know it wasn't healthy for me anymore and I know he probably hates me, but I've been feeling really upset because he was my safe place for the past 5 months, he was the only guy who truly loved me and made me feel safe and now I feel abandoned. Like I have nowhere to go now that im back at my mom's.

 Anyways I guess I’m posting here to ask has anyone else been through something similar? Where your trauma symptoms were misinterpreted as toxicity, or someone turned on you and made you question your core identity after things felt so safe at first?

I really need to know I’m not alone"
877,2,"I just left a game boarding night with my friends and all I am thinking now is all the things I did wrong that probably made other people feel uncomfortable and think I am weird. 

Like staying at the flat too long, or being quite direct with some things. Or complaining a bit about a game rule. Or the fact my friends are hanging out tomorrow but I wasn’t invited. 

I just get the impression that fundamentally they don’t like hanging out with me really. That I am too weird or awkward or I don’t know. None of them call or text me to catch up. 

It’s horrible leaving every social interaction feeling like I have said or done something wrong. 

I hate it. How do I stop being like this =[ "
878,2,"I had a question about my medications so I looked on the electronic health record and in the notes it said I was diagnosed with ptsd but my psychiatrist never told me….is this something that happens? Is it a billing thing? I meet the criteria (went through with my therapist after I saw this because I wanted to know what she thought). I just think it’s weird he didn’t tell me. I’m scared to ask him, like I’ll get in trouble for reading his notes…even though they are accesible to me. "
879,3,"My semester ends next week and it feels like I'm trying to walk to the finish line after having my legs cut off. I have been having the worst paranoia and flashbacks for the last three months, they just keep getting increasingly worse. I don't sleep despite it being all I want to do.  
  
All of the research and reading I do goes straight through me. I can't shape my thoughts into coherent writing if I can even write anything at all. I can't think for five seconds about my work. I know C's get degrees and whatever but it feels bad to pass in work I know isn't reflective of my capabilities. I'm doing my absolute best and I have been all semester but I can't get anything done.

I shouldn't compare myself to others like this but I've known other people with PTSD that excel in school so consistently and it makes me feel so stupid or like I'm doing something wrong. I love research and learning, I want a career in academia, it's not like I don't *want* to do this! But PTSD is making me feel like I can't, and then I feel like I'm just making excuses. So frustrating."
880,1,"I don't have PTSD however, I just wanted to know if regularl family pressure, extreme depression, and critical family pressure, can all of these sum upto PTSD or have I got the understanding wrong completely?"
881,0,"Has anyone tried one of these?  There appear to be several types. My psychologist recommended one type that would involve going to a center for sessions with the device. They also said you take home the device to continue at home. I can't find that combination of in person session plus at home sessions. 

I've found Amen Clinics and I've found several devices you can purchase online without going into a clinic/center. 

Has anyone tried anything like this and/or heard of any that are successful?

Thank you!"
882,2,"Just recently my flashbacks have got realllyy intense. I won’t go into why but basically because of some news in my life. 

Yesterday I tried a new method of stopping a flashback. I tried sooo hard and basically tried to stop having any thoughts and then I felt something pop in my head then got a nosebleed. I was hyperventilating and in such a mess. It was so so so horrible. 

Does anyone else get this or has done this? 

"
883,3,"# 

I used to always be quiet and let people take advantage of me. Let others behave how they want and be inconsiderate of me.

when i was staying at this homeless shelter I tried to wire myself to be assertive because i got tired of constantly being a doormat to every stranger. Little did i know, it would only lead to more hostility, more threats, and more push back from others. When I would read posts on reddit related to this topic, it made me believe that this was the answer to all my problems. In my case, hell no. People don't shut and/or apologize just cause I'm standing up for myself. That was the misconception i had of being encouraged to be assertive. I was fooled. I was misled. AS a matter of fact they see that as a challenge. I remember when i was at the food bank place and this dude tried to lightly push me out of the way and told me not to cut the line. Although he was a liar about that, that still didn't warrant putting hands on me. I proceeded to warn him not to touch and to watch himself. This instigator escalated by taunting me with ""he's trying to play the gangster. and ""i can touch you any time i feel like""

that's when the staff member got in between to quell the incident.

Another time i applied assertiveness was at the shelter. It was midnight and this guy was playing his music from his phone with no headphones. I asked him to turn it off cause i'm going to sleep. He started running his mouth. ""He's always bickering"" ""he's always got something to say"" Then another other guy in the room told me ""we are not in a prison"" he went on to threaten bodily harm

these are just 2 examples. Assertiveness always fails. It just makes the situation worse. If i don't stand up form myself, i lose. If i do stand up, i still lose. I'm slowly starting to develop a fight response to everything because i don't want people to continue to think they can talk however they wanna talk to me and do whatever they wanna do to me. I will do whatever it takes to make these worthless fools back the fuck down or suffer the repercussions. I'm tired of people playing around with me.  
  they say to be more assertive, but that doesn't work either.

884,1,"Hi guysss, 21 f here. I just got diagnoser with PTSD bc of my mother when I was a child and some extreme episodes with police and mentality hospitals...
Well, when I say i feel better today than I've ever had, thats true! I want to live, laugh, i LOVE my bf and a lot about my life! Except from my PTSD... I didn't want to admit it, but my bf helped me through so i can get the help, BUT as u know, that kind of system is SLOW.
Sooo, I was hoping you guys could help me get some coping mechsnisms? Like, when I have flashbacks, break down bc of trauma and all of that. 
I get medicine for my nightmares, which helps a lot! I dont have as many as before, so thats great! But during the day in hear triggering sounds constantly, im scared of going anywhere OR just watching movies bc they may have sirens or a mother like mine... Can you help? Its so draining every single day❤️‍🩹 thank you!🙏"

886,1,"Ever since my best friend got murdered. I have dealt with lots of health issues. Largely stomach related (diagnosed with SIBO, Candida) but by far the worst symptoms are brain fog and fatigue. I’m just sooo tired all the time and I have this physical brain fog sensation where it feels like my head is inflamed and it’s just horrible. 

I’m so disassociated. 

While I am treating the physical ailments, I truly believe my root cause it the trauma I went through. 

Has anyone else got these symptoms? How are you dealing with the fatigue and brain fog?

So over the past couple of months I have done a lot of raging at and blocking people. They ALL deserve it. It is not great for me to be making such a dramatic scene and making enemies but sometimes it is hilarious. I am quite proud of myself for one hilarious quote from my rage last night:

894,3,"Please excuse my english, i’m not a native speaker.

I need your help, i‘m desperate. I got diagnosed with PTSD, depression and anxiety a few years ago. I was raped so many times in my life, that I can’t count . I really fucking hate to say that but it was my brother. He is a few years older than me and he started when i was 10. He showed me some porn, I didn‘t understand what that was. I was young, a child. He explained it to me as a game, went further and further everytime until he eventually raped me. He did that everyday, multiple times, he did not care that I was bleeding or that I was in pain. He did not care that I was a child. He just used me cause it was convenient for him, he just needed to come into my room and rape his little sister. I had my first deep depressive episode at that time, I wasn‘t really present, I haven‘t spoken a word for years, I was so much closer to being dead than being alive. That went for over 3 years. He did it until i got my period cause he never wanted to use a condom.

I tried to ignore it, I shoved it to the very back of my heart. I pretended that everything is normal, I treated him like my brother, like family. We grew up and started to get really close somehow, like best friends. I realized and understood everything when I moved out at 19, that almost killed me. I started my therapy with 21 and said it out loud for the first time in my life.

I‘m in my twentys now and my brother actually became a very nice and empathic person. I feel so ashamed, thats probably some Stockholm Syndrome shit. He has a nice girlfriend, pet, nice apartment, he has a nice life and I am fucking close to kill myself. I talked about it with my therapist, I just didn’t tell her, that it was a family member because I don‘t want to destroy our family, but he doesn‘t deserve these nice people around him. I recently told my parents, that i have a ptsd. I also did not tell who did that to me. I thought for 10 years I could keep it to myself until i started my therapy, I waited 15 years to tell my parents. That felt right but I know that I will never be happy when I continue protecting my brother. I wanna be happy, i wanna find love at the bottom of my heart, I wanna live, I want justice but I can‘t destroy my family, I just can’t. I just feel shame, disgust, pain."
895,2,"Ive had firearms pulled on me twice. Once it went off by my head and missed me. The second was just it being pointed at me. Needless to say I'm terrified of fire arms. I also live in the United States. 

In September 2024 I went to a concert, Green Days Savior Tour, where they played the entirety of Dookie and American Idiot. 
During them playing Longview, the band was rushed off stage at the start of the chorus to Longview. It was chaos. People leaving, people booing and screaming and just general confusion. Turns out that a drone had been flown into the baseball field and that's why the band was rushed off stage. The person who was flying the drone was arrested and the band continued playing. 

However, I've been left struggling to enjoy concerts or even being able to listen to Longview without wanting to throw up and having so much adrenaline flood my system I can taste blood in my mouth. 

I have not been the same since and I feel like I can't talk about it. I thought i was in a potential active shooter situation. My body was in fight or flight. My therapist, who was at the same concert, says it's normal to feel this way but I feel like I can't talk about it to anyone because nothing bad actually happened. But my body has never caught up with my mind on this and I feel lost and alone. 


Thanks for reading. 
"
896,3,"I had a traumatic last trimester, birth and first three months of baby's life.

To start this off, my spouse had military obligations in the last three months on pregnancy and, we knew, would likely miss the birth. He did. He was on the phone for video chat.

I went into labor, and got to the hospital. My doctor was off that day. Who was there but a doctor whom had previously dismissed my problems as being normal. I have endometriosis stage 4. They weren't  normal. So I wasn't happy, but not in a position to complain. After all is was in one of the ""best birthing facilities in the state."" While I was pushing, this doctor went on a lunch break. Even the nurse had an issue with that.

Baby girls oxygen and breath rate kept dropping while I was pushing. I was taken to emergency c section. I'm very claustrophobic and I told them that. I told them I want the curtain as far away from me as possible. They said okay and proceed. They now test if my stomach is numb. I already had an epidural that wasn't working. I could feel the scalpel. So they immediately tie my arms down, and put a gas face mask on me. I fought them till they held my head straight and knocked me out. I came to about 5 hours later.

 Baby was intubated for 10 minutes. So automatically put in NICU. Baby came off and then wasn't eating but I was on narcotic pain killers.  NICU kept calling my room asking me to request to come down because they thought skin to skin would solve it. My nurse kept telling me I couldn't go meet my baby because of the meds. That was a fight. Imagine my pain being told I cant go meet my new baby. My sister in law raised hell for me. She eventually got a hold of the head nurse. What I found out from the head nurse, whom professionally told my nurse to fuck off, was that was absolutely bull shit. They've taken women in comas on stronger drugs than me to the NICU for less than that. Finally, 18 hours after I gave birth, I got to meet her. She stayed in Nicu for 3 days. She was released to my room for 2 days.

Then the car seat test. She was required to keep her oxygen at 90% or more for 1 hour in a car seat. She didn't. She got put back in NICU. 

Now this whole time my spouse was not allowed to come home for the birth from the military ""officially"" by his brigade. The direct higher ups however basically gave a hint hint wink wink LEAVE FOR THE FOUR DAY WEEKEND WHILE YOU ARE NOT BEING CHECKED ON. Red Cross did recommend he come home, but brigade still denied emergency leave. The direct report officers were a god send for him. I'm glad he was given that hint hint. He came back during the 2nd NICU stay.

 Hubby was there for car seat test round number 2. She failed again, but while they were getting a flat bed car seat (those are literally prescribed by the doctor), he noticed her oxygen was cluster dipping in her bassinet. He asked the nurse to check the sensor. Sensor was fine. She called the doctor back up. Doctor said she would fail the flat bed car seat if she was cluster dipping in the bassinet.

Now the doctor started a sleep study. She stopped breathing 27 times an hour. So they put her on oxygen for 2 days and did another test. Same thing, but she significantly improved while on Oxygen. So now they called in a pulmonologist. At least Hubby got to meet him once, but had to go back to the military an hour later.

So enter pulmonologist. He looked at her chart and immediately ordered a test for Central Congential Hypoventilation Syndrome. That is a genetic disorder where people literally forget to breathe while they sleep, and it is deadly. That was the longest 2 weeks of my life. I was looking up every video about it and how to live with it at home. The main thing was going to be a cpap machine ready at all times, and helicopter parent to the EXTREME. I was calling around to daycares in the area to see who might take her, there was only one. That one was over $600 per week because they employed nurses as caretakers. At least I was building a road map for myself. A hard one though. He had us stay in the NICU because if she did have that syndro.e and he sent her home only on oxygen, she would die. If she didn't have it and sent her home with a cpap machine, she would die. At least in the hospital, if she had trouble, she would have the nurses there in seconds.

The test results came back negative. I was so relieved and scared at the same time that I collapsed. I was relieved of the test, but now my road map got stripped away because we were back at Square 1. Not knowing a thing.  

We waited another week and 2 more sleep studies before the pulmonologist diagnosed her with infant sleep apnea. I finally had a road map again. Oxygen 24/7 and an apnea monitor. He believed she would eventually grow out of it, but wanted to see how quickly she would or if she would. So we went home with an o2 tank, concentrator, apnea monitor, and oxygen monitor. 

She was on the oxygen equipment for 3 months and the apnea monitor for 4 months. 

For me, once I had a road map, I was better. Not great, but better. 

I have been diagnosed with ptsd and seek help from both a psychologist and a counselor. I still see my nurse at the end of my bed, the oxygen tube's and hear the concentrator when I am not medicated. They aren't there. I still flip out uncontrollably if I misunderstand some one and think the told me I can't see my little one. The help has significantly helped. 

I know I have a very long road of keeping that help, but I'm glad I got it."
897,2,"Holy shit I've never known hell like PTSD. I've always been very supportive and understanding of mental health, but I'm realizing I never truly understood PTSD.

I didn't realize that it just...takes over you. I guess I thought...I'm not sure what I thought. But I didn't imagine that I'd be in a position where I wake up, get triggered by seemingly nothing, then go cry and rock back and forth in a park for 2 hours. Again. 

Its like a force of pure agony hijacks my body until it spits me back out. Its like I'm not even me, I'm not in my body or mind while triggered. I'm something else. Or more accurately, something else is me for the duration. 

Im so sorry to all of you who are also struggling. I'm very educated and I still had not the slightest clue what PTSD truly was. Much love and coregulation to you all "
898,3,"I was in a car accident over 4 years ago and I'm still not over it. One of the biggest things I struggle with is the pain of the pain. I'd never been in that kind of continuous emotional or mental anguish in my life and that still keeps me up at night. The whole world just rang differently afterwards.

I also struggle to ask for support or tell people what I mean in a way that is actionable to them. I recently realized when I tell people I'm stressed they don't understand a fraction of what I am feeling. It has made it hard to be productive at work and maintain relationships.

I'm also upset because I still can't describe the events of that day. Every time I go to therapy I can't talk about it, I can't write about it, I can't draw about it - but I still physically feel the emotion of that day and its heaviness. "
899,2,"CONTENT WARNING: I mainly focus on my emotional experience, that may feature PTSD-like symptoms. I don’t go into a lot of detail, but I mention infidelity, emotional abuse (witnessing a child being abused and *me* getting abused), suicide grief, self-harm, and ideation). 

——-
To preface, I have not yet been diagnosed with PTSD, but I’m seeking a mental health professional atm. Had a grief therapist, but had to leave her due to moving. 

——-
Overview: 
For context, I’ve just had experience back-to-back experiences over the past 3-4 years such as 
- infidelity
- witnessing psychological child abuse (and emotionally supporting a child)
- emotionally abusive relationship (with someone who acc made me feel listened to and pointed out my experience with childhood emotional neglect —> turned emotionally abusive)
- my sister passing away with suicide (my friends and my most recent ex distanced themselves from me - mostly out of not really understanding my experience and how painful it was).  

—-
Details on my ex’s behaviour after my sister passed from suicide: 
I really struggle with the behaviours of my most recent ex. Such as saying similar things to my ex-friend who was emotionally abusive to me. 

I feel confused because my ex was very sweet and accommodating with my trauma before my sister passed away — we only started dating but he was my friend before (and helped me process my abusive relationship).

And, when I needed a lot more reassurance and validation when my sister passed, he was a lot more distant and shamed me for needing those things. And said, I didn’t need those things as much as I thought I did :) And told me to be independent - when I was grieving and my trauma was being triggered. And, our breakup registered as being traumatic for me — and I feel some shame around it because he kept telling me how he wasn’t as attached to me or he got over it since we weren’t together very long. 

He went to the military a couple months ago and I really had to process how I felt about him (instead of being trapped in an anxious attachment to him). And, my memories make me feel unsafe - and he sometimes meshes with the guy who was abusive to me in my head. 

Even though he was a lot nicer to me and did things for me — which makes me feel really fucked up about it. Because I feel like I shouldn’t be hurt, because he treated me better than someone who was abusive. 

—
My emotional experience: 

I struggle with sleep some days because I’m either angry or I’m anxious. Recalling my past experiences makes me feel scared and confused. Even when my brain stops thinking, I feel anxiety in my body and I feel unsafe (even if I’m safe in my bed). 

I get scared and anxious around people pretty easily. I’m terrified of getting emotionally overwhelmed and being unable to control myself - ie bursting into tears and feeling frozen. Or, defaulting to a trauma response and becoming horrid at communicating. 

My coping mechanisms don’t really help that much. I only feel better when I’m around my designated super safe people, such as my closest childhood friends. 

I’m terrified at the thought of entering a romantic relationship (I keep imagining myself getting anxiety attacks, developing suicidal ideation, and self-harming secretly, if I were to enter one - and then proceeding to hate myself for being “toxic” for having those feelings). Because those feelings have already happened to me a couple times :) and I feel pretty ashamed for it. 

Plus, I’m very up and down every single day. 

And, I kinda had a moment the other week where I feel like PTSD best explains my experience. When I heard PTSD being an experience of “fear and confusion” and an “emotional re-experiencing of the past as the present” where the cognitive part of your brain is literally turned off. I sobbed. Because that’s how I feel sometimes, even if I know why I have trauma and I kinda worked out why people hurt me the way they did. There’s a part of me that keeps feeling like it doesn’t really make sense.  

—- 
*MY BIG QUESTION*: 
I know I really need help (from my community and a professional). 

I don’t really know what to expect with my trauma (whether it’s PTSD or not). Will this fully go away? Or will it get better, but I might need to manage my trauma for the long haul? 

And, is there anything *else* I should do? (Currently seeking out a therapist and going to the gym with my closest friend). "
900,1,"sorry, i’m not sure if i’m in the right place because i’ve never been officially diagnosed and this is my first reddit post so please bare with me.

for context, my first love at 14 SA me multiple times throughout the relationship that lasted around 4 months. 
i was lucky in the fact it could’ve been a lot worse but i have so much guilt over the fact i ‘fawned’ and pandered to him instead of fighting back. 

i didn’t know how to cope so i completely shut down emotionally and physically couldn’t cry no matter how much i eventually wanted to for 3 years. since then when i show emotions (primarily negative ones) feel like im exaggerating and faking it, i was wondering if anyone else felt like this ? it’s been 3 years since and ive only just figured out that a few of the incidents were actually rape, not assault.

I’m not sure I want to move on though. Even if he became a changed man, it doesn’t change the damage he did to me. Sometimes I think deep down k want him to never change because I feel like if he does, I can’t talk about it and I can’t hate him. I’m sorry I’m just kind of confused in my own little brain right now "
903,0,"hi hi, I’m curious if anyone else has experienced similar changes in their menstrual cycle potentially related to PTSD. 

About ten months ago I was diagnosed with PTSD. I spent about ten weeks in PE treatment and achieved subclinical PTSD symptoms. I’ve been subclinical for about 7 months now. A few days ago I started slightly bleeding after not bleeding at all for about 3 years. Has anyone else experienced a regular period after PTSD? 

It’s possible the menstrual changes may be due to changes in exercise, since I’m feeling better now I’ve been regularly exercising for almost a month. Idk maybe it’s impossible to tell what exactly is changing my period. "

My life was great , young guy , lot of energy bright future ahead of him etc 

After my basic studies i decided to go to X location which meant going away from home to start a apprenticeship in the hotel management sector which would last 3 years , i lived alone and the 1st year went great , started making friends going out often , i was under a lot of stress as usually the hotellerie sector is really stress-full so we coped with the long shifts and weeks with drinking a lot and going out on the weekends , had one older friend in the apprenticeship which introduced me to the race scene there , it lead to MDMA , Coke , Speed , all party drugs basically , we also would smoke a lot of weed , and the available weed in that certain region was really bad (synthetic mixed) or laced with something. This all led to becoming worse in the apprenticeship , falling behind in my studies there and taking more and more drugs to cope with the stressful lifestyle. 
What really changed things was when we decided to take shrooms one night , basically horror trip as things happened so unexpected and setting and vibe was ruined after 2 girls from the apprenticeship showed up drunk and that really was when the shrooms kicked in and it somehow really left me speechless at that time. As for the night i somehow managed to make it and calmed myself off. 
The next day , reality , life how i knew it just felt different , i was highly aware , highly sensitive of everything , life was still going on but something changed , kept smoking weed , drinking but i was getting more and more inside my mind , more fearful , thoughtful about everything , it led to me being scared of even going out . I noticed or had the feeling also that at work people started to notice that i was taking drugs , after then everything went downhill , stress , fear , delusion . 

I decided i couldn’t take it anymore and cried for help to my family which flew over , i quit the apprenticeship and i said i need to go a psych ward , i entered got diagnosed psychosis or some weird syndrome , got fed up a ton of pills , but i was aware that i wasn’t that bad/crazy in order to be put there, people there were really crazy.. so i  lasted 2 months there and went back home with my family.

Years passed by i traveled solo a lot to try to find my inner self again/ fix things . 

Those years basically crushed/changed the happy self i was and years have flown  by , i am writing this and realizing already 7 years have past but something in me still has bits or traces of that experience which im holding on to or which cant be unshaken off . I managed to lead a decent life but if i am happy or ever will be i don’t know for now 

I prayed every day to the universe and to god to bring me or my life to a better place , familiar terrain where i once was happy with . 

I just wanted to write down some feelings which i cant share with anyone else , thank you for listening me

Much love"
907,1,"I haven't been okay for a really long time. I'm only recently coming to terms with just how not okay I am.

It's like I could ignore it and hope it goes away as long as I can function.

I haven't been able to function for a couple years now. In hindsight I was just functioning in a messed up way and have always been hanging by a thread.

I feel like my entire personality was erased and replaced with coping mechanism upon coping mechanism.

I don't even really know who I am. It's all just trauma and symptoms of trauma.

For some reason last night I was up all night with everything going through my head.

I haven't been okay since I was like 4 years old and I'm in my 30s now and I'm still not okay.

I've tried getting all the free help I can get.

I'm currently looking for a therapist but I've also been retraumatized by past useless therapists. What's the point of paying out of pocket when you can't even get a refund when they fuck you over?

I'm also feeling guilty about even seeking help because there are people who survived war and got dismembered and so on and so forth and they seem to cope with that better than I can cope with any of my problems which makes me feel like this milder PTSD/C-PTSD is me being weak not being able to shoulder it. I know how that sounds and that it's not rational but that's what's going on in my head right now.

I don't want to go into details about the numerous traumas I've dealt with but I've dealt with a lot more compared to most people I know. However I also read horror stories online about the horrendous abuse some people have survived and again that just makes me feel like I'm somehow just a weak person.

But also fuck that thinking because if I was a weak person I wouldn't be able to help that so like take some of the pressure off myself already?

The last time I was around people I could actually relate to because they'd also been through some stuff was when I was at a homeless shelter.

I used cigarettes/nicotine/caffeine/alcohol to manage my symptoms and they stopped working. I had to quit drinking a couple years back because that cheesy thing is true ""One is too many and there is never enough.""

Currently working on rediscovering cannabis as a form of harm reduction and because I need a break from life once in a while.

If I were someone else I would say this to them:

""Your experiences and suffering are valid and just because some people had it worse doesn't mean that you don't matter. You matter a lot and you deserve the help you need to get better.""

But for some reason I always treat myself like garbage probably because I was raised by a family that treated me like garbage and I've internalized that I'm garbage.

Also any therapist is going to be like ""What are your goals?"" It's like honestly my only goal is for my constant suffering to end. I don't mean that in a suicidal way but in an I'm suffering right now and I want to get better so that the suffering stops way.

Anyway I guess I just need to vent because I'm absolutely sick of existing like this.

People always tell me how strong I am for shouldering things. I DON'T WANT TO BE STRONG ANYMORE. I want to be weak and be taken care of and not feel like I'm waging war against the world all by myself.

Anyway I guess that's all I have to say for now.

Fuck my life!"
908,2,Hey I’m just wondering if I’m the only one getting sharp pain in my chest and my heart feeling like it’s burning/being sticked with a needle. I’ve done a ECG the doc says it looks normal but it really feels like something is very wrong it’s not constant it comes and goes. it’s the worst right before I fall asleep I’m diagnosed with ptsd please tell me if some off you guys also get this kinda pain.
909,1,"I was sent off to prep school at 9 and for over the past month I’ve been really struggling to deal with my memories there. There was a lot of inappropriate touching directed at me by a few of the teachers and some physical violence as well things like slapping, kicking, being thrown into the wall and spanking my rear while forcing my head down on a desk. I was threatened by my matron with no privs (basically you have to sit on a bench outside the headmaster’s office during recess and you couldn’t buy sweets from the tuck shop) if I didn’t strip in front of the school doctor and a teacher (I never saw the school doctor outside of ‘penis inspections’) i think she may also have been drugging me as she give me a white pill to help me sleep and another teacher would give give squash with a few drops of a liquid night remedy, my matron even tried to get my mom to put me on sleepwalking medication by telling her she’d find me walking around the school at night. I’d pretty regularly be sent out of my rooms by the dorm monitor and teachers would sometimes tell you to wait in the dinning room or classrooms. This eventually led the sexual abuse where I was taken into the kitchen and raped I remember being told how much of a rotten apple i was and a faggot for getting an erection it was pretty violent and the way I make sense of it was that I was too young and I didn’t understand the difference between wrath and lust so I don’t think I was groomed. But this went on for two years and towards the end I think I wanted it, I remember talking to a teacher who had recently stopped the abuse about our relationship and got really angry and was twisting my ear when he said what relationship ship and I eventually said teacher student"
910,2,"

I've had some, comparatively minor, incidents of inappropriate touch. 

I'm 30F. Never been with a man, but I have crushed on some. I've only been with a woman. 

Currently I'm crushing on a man, but frankly, thinking or looking at a penis makes me feel extremely sick and my brain completely shuts down. I feel I would never be able to look at or touch one. 

Has any one had similiar experiences and thoughts and feelings? Have you found some clarity about what you're looking for? 

I don't really feel safe with anyone. I wish I didn't crave sex, but I do. 

"
911,1,"I can’t even function. I’m 17 and already have X10 more trauma than most adults. Getting raped,abused,bullied,attempted kidnapped,attempted murdered etc. I do not want to live. I feel so hopeless. Over the years I’ve become less and less human. 

All I do all day lately is vape in bed. I don’t go to college (uk). I don’t have a job. I’m just pathetic. I have no friends. 

These past few weeks I’ve gone from being hypersexual to basically being asexual. Have barely slept. Like I’ve not slept in three days atp. I don’t find enjoyment in anything. Ive been basically constantly in a flashback or dissociation. 

I’ve barely been doing anything. I’ve not watched Tv. My screen time in general has gone down a lot. I used to be a full time content creator. And watch videos a lot. Now I post maybe once a week. I don’t find the joy in it even though it was one of my favourite things to do and it’s my only source of income other than disibility allowance. But even the indesentive of money I just can’t be bothered.

I just want to do nothing all day. Like literally I spend hours just staring at a wall and vaping. I try to sleep so I can skip that but I can’t. 

I used to want help but there is none. Not for me anyway. I’ve tried. I’m either too mentally ill or not mentally ill enough. 

And honestly at this point even if I did have help. It wouldn’t change anything. I’m too far gone. 

I feel crazy. Most people even in situations like mine at least do stuff. I don’t at all. I feel bedridden. And sometimes I am from physical thing because I’m chronically ill. But I feel it’s most of the time I’m mentally bedridden. It’s hard to explain but even just getting up is mentally painful. I am that broken. I know it’s pathetic that I’m this broken over the things that happened to me but honestly I know for sure this isn’t fixable.

I wish I could be killed. It’s the only way to end this. I’m not contributing anything to society anyway. For the rest of my life I know I’m going to be in bed all. Or homeless all day whatever."
912,2,"So many people are talking about the positive effects of psychedelic assisted therapy, I've been a psychedelic user as well in the past but I never did it in therapy..

The results are promising and I see there's even someone saying they cured PTSD completely.. Which is amazing if true, Van Der Kolk talks in a very good way about it too.

I've found a therapist who's following me in microdosing, and she also talked about full doses of MDMA/Psylocibin... Honestly the thought of keep living with this disorder is too unbearable at least for me, and I'm also tired of ""learning how to deal with it"", I want it to completely and permanently go away, or at least to not have symptoms for years.. There is no way in between I'm going to accept anymore, and honestly the other alternative would probably be taking my life. So if there's even the slightest possibility of it curing PTSD and making me start to trust myself and others, I want to do it."
913,2,"Quick background, abusive childhood, enough to learn my fight, flight, freeze, and fawn response is primarily fight and sometimes flight. Silence and slight aggression ALWAYS turned into all out violent fights in my house and while rarely directed at ME, it was almost always at my younger siblings so I always had to fight to keep them safe. Was diagnosed with PTSD at 8 and was still IN the situation, so I could never tell responses were PTSD til recently.

The last 2 years, my fiance moved in with me despite my warning my family was BAD. He helped mitigate things for a while, but we moved cross country back to his home town after half a year and I genuinely never thought I would feel this safe with anyone. He’s seriously amazing. That’s why it’s so frustrating when the PTSD gets triggered by him over the slightest things.

The first time I noticed an actual POST traumatic stress event, he snapped into a microphone to check it was on before gaming. That’s it. My body immediately froze, started shaking, sobbing, had that fear and flashbacks. I KNEW consciously even that first time that there was NO danger, that he was just testing a microphone, that he wasn’t going to blow up over anything, yet the response wouldn’t stop. Had multiple situations like that in the past year.

Yesterday morning, probably had the worst event I’ve experienced yet. Been working 12 hour night shifts all week and body has already been on edge and exhausted. Fiance had a rough morning and had to come pick me up from work. He tends to be quiet when he’s upset. The silence when he got me, then the car jerked a little by accident when shifting gears and that combo sent me into an immediate panic attack and having to fight my own body not to jump out of the moving car. He was immediately apologetic for contributing to the trigger and trying to comfort and calm me down, but once the physical response starts, there really isn’t anything I can do until I ride it out.

These responses were always awful, but felt normal enough while I still lived with my family bc these were my natural responses to the violence and yelling and all that. Now it’s not a reasonable response and I can THINK clearly enough to know and try to assure myself that everything is okay, but the shaking and hyperventilating and crying and fight or flight still kick in and it drives me absolutely crazy. I really hope this fades more as time passes, even if slowly. This is almost worse than being in the thick of shit actively.. how tf do you fight your own brain"
914,1,"Hi all!

Wondering if any of you have had experience with gaining weight after a traumatic event. My ex (husband) and I separated almost a year ago and it was one of the craziest times in my life. Without getting into too much detail, it felt like I was living a nightmare and also in some twisted psychological thriller. I’ve thankfully been able to start over and create a peaceful life for myself since. I’m still dealing with a lot of PTSD symptoms like nightmares and triggers, but overall I’m SO much better than I was at this time last year.

Unfortunately, all the stress from before the separation and after has caused me to gain some weight. I work a VERY physical job and don’t have the money to eat too much junk, so I’m wondering why it’s been harder to lose this weight. And while I am happy being a curvy woman, the current way my body looks just feels not like myself. Like just another thing the relationship messed up for me.

Have any of you had this happen to you?

PS Yes, I am seeing a therapist. I recently changed to one that specializes in trauma therapy so I’m hoping I can make some more progress. It’s been a tough year."
915,0,"I was diagnosed with ptsd due to dv. I have some neurological manifestations not due to a brain injury.  I saw a phenomenal neurologist who did an MRI which was negative for any type of structural damage that would cause symptoms. They also are scheduling an EEG to confirm no seizure activity. 

My neurologist believes neurological symptoms are manifestations of several years of dv (not causing any head injury that could cause symptoms).  They diagnosed me with ptsd and discussed plan.

I have question on whether anyone has had a PET scan and if so, did they trigger a response from you so they could see overactivity in certain parts of the brain?

I don't think getting a PET would change the diagnosis or treatment plan. However, I've been researching it and i now really want to see a medical image of my brain showing areas affected. 

Would love to hear if anyone got one done. Thanks!!"
916,3,Guys I really cant handle the insomnia anymore I havent slept a night in 2 years im awake days and days maybe to grab an hour its exhausting its hell. The chronic pain & the hypervigillance feeling like my head is going to explode is just hell. Its pure hell. I just want to sleep & not wake up.
917,0,"I just wanted to share my story to give people hope that they can overcome their PTSD, as when I was in the depths of mine I thought there was no way out!

Trigger warning as I'm going to discuss my PTSD and something that happened to me today that would've previously triggered it

I was diagnosed with PTSD in 2019 after an incident happened where my best friend at the time went into drug-induced psychosis from smoking weed and locked me & my friends in the room while they guarded the door with a kitchen knife. It was terrifying and we didn't know what would happen to us.

My main symptom was horrendous dissociation/derealisation and I didn't feel present or real for a good few years after it. I am someone who loves being solo - solo travel, solo dates - and it got so bad I couldn't even be alone as I was scared of my own brain. My night terrors were also terrible.

I really worked hard on my mental wellbeing - went to CBT - as well as just working on my mindfulness, gym, meditation. I didn't want to take meds.

Eventually things started to get better - and today I experienced something that would've once been a huge trigger for me but instead I felt nothing. A man going through psychosis was shouting at me in the street - this probably would've caused me to head into deep dissociation for weeks and I would've had panic attacks previously. But today I was able to just go about my day as normal after it happened.

It can 100% get better and I wish everyone get to the place I am now at where my mind is no longer my enemy. I no longer experience dissociation which I really thought I would be dealing with for life."

Hello, I am writing this from the Philippines, I can't eat and drink at our house, I have developed fear of swallowing, when I swallow, I produce sound, I am very embarrassed about it, here is my story...

I am a 20 year old female suffering from rare diseases, I have symptoms of IMBS (Intestinal Metabolic Bromhidrosis Syndrome), it is Chronic Halitosis, I started having this since from my 7th grade, it was a day-to-day struggle for me, physically and mentally, to be sitting in class, afraid of those around me, I struggled breathing because I still produce malodor even when not speaking, I was exhausted, I've went to different doctors in our area, including dentists, ENT, and gastroenterologist, nothing helped. The pandemic was a break for me, as everything was becoming online, I didn't have to wake up everyday in anxiety, thinking about whether I would go to school or not, I was relieved. But this didn't last, in the end of 2020, my uncle decided to come into our house from Manila due to financial struggles brought by the pandemic, he came first, and then his family, I was insecure, worried, and stuck, I didn't know how I would communicate with them, I stayed in my room all day, they lived with us for 7 months, within this months, it was tough, they were shock and it was hurtful for me seeing them uncomfortable just because I have this condition, my body was inactive and tensed as I was always on my room and didn't want to be outside, I felt restricted, I was worried about so many things as well, there are sleepless nights were I would think about what would I do if ever the pandemic would end, I knew I would come back to school and experience tremendous anxiety again, it was just thoughts everywhere. I looked for solutions on the internet, and found out about this breathing exercise, it's called Mewing, it wasn't that famous at that time so when I heard about it, I was really intrigued, those who practice it gave some benefits as it's creator suggested.
I tried practicing it for a week, but I was tired doing the practice so I left it, surprisingly it helped me ""position"" my jaw better without thinking about it, it was great, but I wasn't content with my facial structure, I don't know what I was thinking at those moments but I became conscious of my look, maybe because of the practice itself, you wouldn't believe it but I tried manipulating my jaw's position, something triggered an energy in my body, as if the years of stress I was hiding came out and suddenly I felt an arousal I couldn't control. I remember lying down to sleep and I was baffled, I woke up feeling falling, since then I developed symptoms of trauma.
I was feeling foolish and shock about it, how can a small thing cause such thing?
My cousins and my aunt returned to their province, my uncle left... perhaps they noticed it wasn't a good idea to stay, everyone in our house seemed stressed...
After months of my symptoms and thinking how to get rid of it, our class started, it was online, it helped me so much not to think about those painful things I was feeling at those times. I became at top of our class.
But it didn't lasts, the next year, we were moving to face-to-face classes, I moved to homeschooling, I became feeling depressed and alone, this is just this time where I knew I was suffering from trauma, I tried handling it, but I felt very insecure about myself.
I made it to college, I was anxious entering but I had to, surprisingly, a classmate back in my online class whom I was really fond with became my classmate, she helped me navigate through it all, tho it made her somehow drained, I am very thankful for her presence ... and very sorry, I dropped out the next semester, I felt it was the right thing to do.
My cousin returned in our house, he studied here, my uncle was sort of abusive towards him, my uncle runs a small lottery outside our house, he would shout at my cousin most of the time, I was very troubled by it, our neighbors where very nosy about us, everything didn't helped, my other cousin came as well, they all came to study, it was all stressful, every morning they would bang the door. I went back to school as well, I thought being always at home would make the situation worse, as I battle Halitosis and symptoms of trauma, my nervous system was all high alert, I am thinking if things would get better, one day, I saw myself laying at our stair outside, exhausted, extremely exhausted, I couldn't determine clearly my surroundings, I thought the door back in our room is the door outside through our house, I cried, I shouted, I shouted with no sound coming from my mouth, my neck cracked, the feeling was terrifying, the pain I have been carrying brought my body down, my feet, my hands, in stinging pain.
One night I couldn't lay in my bed, as if my body wants to run, I tried to sleep, I remember forcing myself to lay down, feeling my spine somehow not in its right position, I tried swallowing, it doesn't feel right, I was obsessive, it's like I am losing balance, I knew I didn't have to pay so much attention to it, it's just a small thing, but I keep swallowing, trying to get that balance, but I couldn't, I was embarrassed since it produced sound, I remember my grandfather hearing me that night and he was disturbed, I was unsettled, I woke up feeling falling, I swallowed, but something in me tried to stop it, as if there was a rush of energy flowing through out my body, ever since this has been the case, my cousins were laughing at me every-morning, I could hear their laughs, I tried to ward of everything, I knew what was happening and I had to relax my self, but it was like a tumor that grows, I was not able to eat and drink around the house anymore due to it, I was always laying down, everything feels like I am not in control anymore, I am very sensitive to people screaming, shouting, coughing, flashing lights, I was perplexed, as if something is tied up to my throat ready to drag me down, am I getting crazy? This was so easy to do, it was the most easiest thing to do.
Trauma, trauma, trauma.
Everyday I have to go out, just to eat and drink, I couldn't stay at our house, my body is dying day by day. My parents don't understand. I'm still hoping things will get better and things will get back to normal, even though that normal is the hardships I have went through before all of this."
919,2,"I had a pretty tough life, but when I was 18, I went through some traumatic events. I was stuck in a cycle of torture and abuse that lasted for a year. Eventually, I moved forward, but I still feel like my body is always in fight-or-flight mode. Other people don’t understand, and I feel like people are generally insensitive about my situation. They get irritated that I’m anxious all the time, and I shut down. I've been having this recurring dream about the trauma ever since it happened—it's been six years now. I’ve never gone to a therapist or sought any professional help. I recently learned that what I’m experiencing could be a sign of PTSD.

"
920,2,"So ive started talking to a guy and things are going okay, he's sweet and seems genuienly intrested in me. Right now we're just in the talking stage but im scared that once/if things progess that he'll leave or get scared once i tell him i have PTSD around sex. 

How do i tell him my triggers are unexpected touch or really most touch from men? How do i tell him some words send me into fight or flight? How do i tell him that most of my episodes arent too bad but the worst ones have me acting like a scared, angry animal who wants nothing more than to hide until everything goes away? How do i tell him that theres this giant ball of rot inside me that makes me unable to recognize my own face most days. 

Im terrified that he'll see me for the scared, angry, rabid thing i am after my abuse and he'll leave. That il scare him off by being too broken by what happened. I want to try to trust again, i want to experience love and be able to love back, but at the same time im terrified that one wrong move, one bad reaction, one flinch, and he'll leave. Part of me thinks its a bad idea to let him or any man get close to me, both for their sake and mine, but the other part is curious and excited to see where this could even lead. 

Im scared and excited and nervous and happy all at once and i have no idea how to even begin to process all the constant emotions that flow in my head, both the good and bad. "
921,2,"Can't afford hospital, was at therapy yesterday, appointment again in a week

Takes almost nothing to set it off, my nervous system feels like it's on fire, can't sleep, wake up stuck in loop of flashbacks for hours 

I can feel his hands on me right now it doesn't stop, I feel myself being raped over and over and over I can't do this I don't know what to do, it's never been like this so constantly for so long, I don't even know why this is happening 

Missed work on Friday cuz I couldn't move, couldn't get out of the loop, was stuck for 15 hours

Have to work tonight but I'm afraid to have flashbacks in front of people, afraid of how the night will go, and so exhausted 
Can't call off again though "
922,3,"So I'm 14yrs old male student from india in 8th grade and my parents want me to study in IIT (the most prestigious university in India they say) and they want me to study extra for iit prep after school. And I agreed to that but the work i have after class is too much and I don't have any time to do my homework. So i sometimes couldn't complete them

One day I couldn't complete my maths homework and told my teacher the same before checking(i didn't do it the day before too due to some personal work). Idk what the fuck was going on in his mind then but he just grabbed my hair, slammed me to the ground and repeatedly slapped my head in front of everyone (its common for teachers to hit students with a stick but not like this).he then called me a degenerate and said that I'm useless. My classmates repeatedly bring it up to me and make fun of it. My friends are toxic and I don't even want to talk to them anymore. I have no friends now. I can't forget about it and it always comes to my head every few minutes and i have nightmares about it(im a bit sensitiveto insults and this was too much for me). I told my parents about it and they said ""he probably did it for your benefit. What would he get by hitting you"" and to make it worse they said that i deserve it coz i dont study well.I have no interest in IIT and want to do something else but my parents won't listen .I feel hopeless and more pressurized by this iit prep. I need help to forget about it (its been 6 months btw) "
923,2,"I have a friend who lived in an abusive family, she saw every kind of things, from her relatives being mistreated, to animals, and lived with a narcissist father and mother who simply was enslaved emotionally to him for her whole life. Her cousins all do cocaine, her sister do cacaine etc.. Maybe it's because she never faced life threats directed towards herself?

Sure she is disorganizedly attached and kinda controlling with her boyfriend but at least they can be together, she doesn't deal with addictions, panic attacks, dissociation and suicidal ideation, she has a direction in life, while I was dealing with my chaos even in my longest relationship and I was just depressed, unable to do anything, and have periodic crises which put me into isolation and make suicidal even for months sometimes, she also never did therapy or took any meds.

While I understood I also come from a difficult situation: my mother was depressed and suicidal and almost threw me off of a cliff when I was five.. I always had issues, from substance abuse to sexual addictions, from suicidal ideations to panic attacks.. I've been in therapy for 4 years, I took meds etc.. But if i compare my childhood to her childhood I just think mine has been a walk in a park compared to hers.

So why am I just blocked into anxiety and panic attacks for days sometimes, I fear intimacy and can isolate and be actively away from relationships for months, have dissociation, re-traumatize myself in toxic relationships etc etc etc..? Was she just lucky? She is just blocked in her controlling stategy which currently works and have left dissociation holding and waiting?

It just doesn't feel right, but I'm happy for her indeed."
924,3,"im (29/m) not sure what to do anymore. ive tried trauma work in the past but i go downhill like crazy when i bring stuff up. the sharp increase in all symptoms is unbearable, cant drive or work when im like that. therapist and i have agreed to just work on maintenance and stabilization for the last few years

but im not maintained or stable and dont think i can be if i dont address my trauma. this ""maintenance"" period has seen me almost lose my dream job several times because of having to call off or leave early due to disruptive symptoms and several mental health crises. ive had to take weeks long breaks because of said breakdowns. i am unspeakably lucky that my upper management has been so supportive and that they really view me as a great employee or i would have been booted years ago (im still getting warnings all the time about my attendance though)

so im completely lost. i feel like my life is some sort of hellish purgatory. cant do proper treatment and hold down a job, cant hold down my job without proper treatment. what do i do???"
925,2,"I haven't been able to get trauma therapy yet, I get triggered on a daily basis and it's sometimes really hard to avoid the triggers so can you please give me some tips that will make it easier for me to ignore the triggers or not react so badly?"
926,1,"So i’m recovering from CPTSD and i’ve never actually looked at my parents in a way as if they did something wrong. My healing proces brought me to causes way beyond what they are responsible for themselves. Think of the patriarchy, conservative cultural norms, finding a way out of poverty.

I’m glad i’m able to see the causes of their choices and behaviours. But i guess i’m starting to feel something like grief and anger around what was missing instead of around what was present.

Looking back, i missed being acknowledged, stimulated and met with curiosity around being a child and discovering the world & my passions.

It feels as if i’m only starting to do so now, but at this age you can’t discover without responsibilities. I’m grieving the loss of being able to be a careless child. Learning in safety and experimenting without massive consequences. I find myself enraged about capitalism the past weeks.

Writing this, i think i’m making huge progress but it sucks to go through this."
927,0,"I started learning German a couple months into my healing journey, and I found that there are so many words I get to learn as if no stigma is attached, even if they describe difficult things. I found some sanctuary in this. Communication and stigmatized language is a big part of my trauma struggle, so learning an entirely new language with its own greetings, kind remarks, and culture, really feels comforting. 

I think it’s because I’m forced to acknowledge that everyone couldn’t possibly speak/treat me passive aggressively like “they” did, because in another language, they say “es tut mir leid” to apologize, or “Entschuldigung“ to say excuse me, and it feels polite the way English words used to when I was a kid, because I’m not immediately thinking “sorry can be bad, what happened, am I in the way?” Instead, I think “ I know that ‘es tut mir leid’ means ‘brings me great sorrow’ which seems like an endearing way to comfort someone.” It’s sort of grounding, and it reminds me that my experiences inform the way I feel about words. I don’t know if Entschuldigung can be a rude “excuse me” but I don’t care to find out because I’m just peacefully language learning😂

If you’re like me, consider picking up a language learning app and playing casually☺️ I know many of us often think, “I wish I could just start everything over without learning to be afraid of x, y, z” and learning a language is just as easy to say and hard to do, but is a grand reminder that words are just noises designed to translate soundless thoughts :)

I also feel that the natural relationship between the native and new language helps me remember that “excuse me” doesn’t have to be rude or whatever other presupposition, because I know the translation “Entschuldigung” is polite. This is especially helpful, as the words I have simple/multiple translations for feel way less stigmatized. 

What are your thoughts?"
928,1,"hi i'm 29 years old i have noticed that i suffer from excessive fatigue and inability to tolerate exertion and brain fogg and a decline of cognitive abilities , despite the fact all my blood tests are okay ,i had traumas and developed negative habits like isolation .

is this condition a result of ptsd or something else.

929,2,"I’ve been battling with PTSD for awhile now and have been recently trying so hard to manage it better (without medications) but with mental health professionals and I’ve been dedicated to CBT therapies and journaling and what not. But the BIGGEST issue I’ve been facing lately and the hardest thing for me to work around is being able to maintain my friendships with people that have either never experienced PTSD or just truly don’t understand it. For example, my partner- a cis gender man, listens to my experiences, shows sympathy (sometimes empathy) and tries to relate and be an open resource. But holy fuck dude like wdym you don’t understand why I don’t want you to just casually say “I want to k*ll you” like why are YOU having a meltdown and WHY am I comforting you because I set a boundary and said “hey that’s not funny” and now you’re upset bc you think I’m calling you a bad person. Like !? Am I insane bc I know I’m not. It’s just really hard to be myself and go out with my friends like every other 21 yr old college girl does but holy shit they can be so incredibly obtuse sometimes it just makes it hard for me to hang out with them. I asked my friend recently if there’s something I’m doing wrong why it feels like I’m always left out of things and I asked her like do I come on too strong? Do I trauma dump too often (bc that’s something I’m very avidly trying to not do) it’s just like if you ask me how my day is or how I’m feeling I don’t want to have to fucking lie to my FRIEND just so it doesn’t cause them more stress. Idk I know most of my friends are also mentally struggling 21 yr olds (which I’m learning is a fucked age to be for everyone) but I feel like while I’m trying to make room for their struggles and be patient and understanding with them- I’m not met with that same energy. My friend told me that when it’s everytime that they’re talking to me, that I talk about something serious and intense- that sometimes “small talk” is just necessary and it doesn’t have to be all intense stuff all the time. But I’m like… THATS MY LIFE. It just truly is serious and intense like 98% of the time. I just don’t know how I’m supposed to nurture these friendships and always be the one to reach out when it feels like they just don’t match the energy, they just don’t reciprocate the care. I really love and care about my friends so much is the thing, they ALL know I would drop just about anything for them if they needed me. It just sucks when they wouldn’t do the same for me I guess. How do I get them to understand and/or how do I be okay with them not being able to understand? "

They've also become more creative than just my trauma it's now become my trauma and whatever thing my brain can come up with to scare me

Does anyone know why they're so bad? I had a recent episode of flashbacks from an event of trauma but that was almost a week ago usually I'd be okay by now "

932,1,"My last friendship fucked me so much mentally. Even tho it has been 7 months since they broke up with me, I still feel the ramifications. I get nightmares about the break up, I can't trust anyone and feel always on the edge around strangers, I don't wanna have friends anymore even tho loneliness is hurting me too. Every interaction with another human is just torture. I hate myself even more than i already do and just feel like a worthless piece of shit nobody wants and I'm just a burden to anyone and I feel like I don't deserve this life. This friendship changed me negatively and I will never recover from it or will never be able to let it go. They might be reading this but I don't care anymore they really hurt me. I used to be understanding and charitable and I would forgive them anything bad they did but now I just wanna erase them from my mind. Even tho they saved my life, they made it worse as well. I'm sitting here, crying my eyes out bc of one interaction with a stranger that I deeply regret not saying no and go away and now I just feel so much anger and I'm so agitated and I scream nonstop and loud in my flat. I'm not even crying bc of this friendship but my brain can't control my thoughts anymore and so it has to think about it among other things and in general every thoughts makes my mental breakdown worse. I wish I don't have to rely on other people and just live in the middle of nowhere, only me and my thoughts. No human interaction, never again. I hate humans so much. Even tho I don't want to be alone, I also don't want friends or partners or anything bc I can't survive another breakup and I'm a burden anyway."
933,0,"My dear parner (she/they) , we will call them 'A', suffered CSA by a relative when she was young. The relative was a woman who broke not only the family bond but trust with 'A'. This relative was also a victim, which lead to her actions against 'A', but of course this does not justify it.

'A' trusted this relative, what they did together felt 'fun' until 'A' aged and realised it was wrong, growing disgusted by it and was able to put a stop to it, though this left a lot of trauma.  
'A' is now an adult and feels what they faced feels invalid. Like no one went through the same thing 'A' did because it's not been in media they have seen before. When a recent celebrity outed himself to have COCSA with his cousin, it was taken as a joke which made 'A' feel even more isolated in their experience.

So I have come here to ask if anyone has media that represents: CSA from a female family member who is also a victim of similar circumstances?  
Not pornography, but something that represents this sort of thing so that 'A' can feel less alone in their experience.. thank you."

- Trigger warnings for medical trauma and reference to suicide -

I hadn’t been to a hospital since my event happened, and hospitals are huge triggers.  I had sworn I would have to be dragged by my hair to ever go back to a hospital, but I went yesterday because my health was worsening and I was terrified.  

I wrote this through the perspective of someone with different pronouns, to try to make sense of this, process it.  

_____________________________________

Sometimes, with pain or sickness, the feelings can come in waves.  They can be further apart and intense, or closer together and predictable, but there’s always a moment—even if it passes faster than a lightning strike—where you could find your sanity.  But not with this.  This filled every second of his agonizing awareness.  Just like the foreign body blocking the airway to his lungs.  And he felt it.  Every inch of it.  His brain couldn’t even protect him from it, not until it was all over.  A sick and cruel game—for  him and others— forced to bear the burden of survival with no good reason in sight.  

He hated how naked he felt before them.  Hadn’t he already been violated enough by the eyes and hands of every doctor and nurse who touched, cleaned, and explored every inch of his body?  He didn’t care that it was all to help him, to “save” him.  Every pair of eyes laid on his exposed being had just been another wound, another piercing to his skin, and now he was forced to go through it all again, just so he could prove to a bunch of strangers that he deserved the relief of knowing his reaper could be kept far away from him?  Cycling through an endless rotation so that he could spare others, but never himself?  Where was the justice in that? 
Then he remembered. 

It’s only when he’s faced with the possibility of death that he realizes just how badly he wants to live, but to live well. He doesn’t want to be in this constant struggle to keep himself alive and not be able to do the most basic human things of eating, drinking, walking, and being able to do anything on his own. He realizes he might just be more afraid of death than he ever was all those times he wished for it—when he realizes there’s a chance, the slightest chance, that one day he’d be living so well he wouldn’t regret pushing through each of these moments just to get there. If that’s possible and that’s real, he doesn’t want to lose that.
But he did.  He had it, for one week, then he lost it. 

It’s that thought, of having and losing that which scares him.  Giving it up after a lifetime of agony is an entirely different thing; there’s never been such fear when there was choice and control—even if helplessness and the lack of control are what drags him to that point. It’s not having a choice, it’s not knowing when he could be gone, not knowing if it would hurt, not knowing if he’d get the chance to leave something behind for his loved ones if it was sudden. That’s what scares him, he thinks—but it’s not what scares him the most.

As real as the fear of nonexistence is, the fear of continuous existence like this scares him exponentially more.  Not knowing anything at all just leaves him helpless and afraid, wondering what could happen and if it would ever be worth it to stick around and let these wounds build up.  If he at least knew, then he could hope—or he could make peace with things.  If he knew, he’d be given more than enough strength to get to where he would eventually be, or he could let go with the peace of mind that he doesn’t deserve to live a life of endless torture with no end in sight.  It would make it all less scary.  For him.

But it’s all just a game, to something, to someone. Could be the universe, God, or some human who hates him enough to wish this upon him, but either way, it’s a game to them. A game he’s pretty sure is single-player—and one he was mistakenly chosen for.  He was never meant for this.

935,2,"There doesn't seem to be much on the topic of hyperarousal on here so I figured I'd ask directly. Can PTSD symptoms actually resolve (specifically hyperarousal) with one instance of uncomplicated PTSD with no prior history of mental health problems? 

Most posts on here seem to be around C-PTSD with a long history of repeated trauma so I'm having a hard time to relating to them. Also, I'm assuming this thread may be a pretty biased sample of folks who are posting about extreme symptoms... no offense to anyone, I'm just looking for some clarity on the subject.

**Some background---**

I'm a young adult (39m) and I've been really affected by the hyperarousal. This all started \~3 months ago. And has really (now) transformed into anxiety fromthinking this is a permanent health situation more than anything else.

I am very open about the incident. It doesn't scare me to think about / talk about it... the event that caused it doesn't send me into a panic. That said, I do have a some guilt / shame tied to it. What bothers me more now is that I've done irreparable damage to my nervous system / anxiety levels.

I have good family support around me and am open about discussing it - in fact it's all I've wanted to talk about as I'm desperate to return to normal life. I have never had or dealt with any trauma before so this is a one-off instance. 

I've recently been on Cymbalta (SNRI) and that greatly helps with the depression and anxiety but I can tell my nervous system still isn't calming down and is stuck. I can't sleep (without medication) and I have a hard time sitting / relaxing. I've lost all interest in hobbies, television, friends, etc. I am sensitive to loud noises and have a slight ringing in my ears. I don't have any hypervigilance where I'm scanning for threats, I'm just on high alert from my nervous system - my brain is working overtime.

I did not have any mental health issues AT ALL prior to this happening so it's been quite concerning.

I've been seeing a therapist (CPT) and trying to ""process"" my trauma (although I'm still not really sure what that means yet) as I believe I've accepted it - it's not like I'm scared of it happening again or anything. That makes me think the de-sensitizing therapies, like EMDR, won't really work for me (although maybe I'm wrong)

Anyway, thanks for any advice!"
936,0,"I find that people who don’t have PTSD don’t get PTSD.

How did you meet?"
937,2,"So I know that it's normal to block out memories. One of the more traumatic periods of my life happened 5 years ago. I feel like I should be able to remember more because it wasn't that long ago. I find it confusing that I can't because the first 2 years after I felt and remembered everything vividly(I was definitely not better for it). 
I know that my brain is trying to protect me but it's confusing to not fully be able to recall things that you knew you could at one point. I feel like what I'm saying doesn't even make sense.

938,1,"My birthday has always given me such a odd mix of emotions, as a kid i had many birthdays where no one showed up, were ruined by someone and many that meant everything to me.

But by far my 12th birthday was the worst one. 

I remember blowing out my candles, my friend being driven home and ""him"" texting me to let him in my building..

My mom was maybe gone 15 minutes at the most but it felt like hours.
I remember how my dog and cat looked at him, my cat that ive had since i was little ran away when he looked at her.. my dog barked..

I am turning 19 this month and i still feel him in my room.
Why did i let him in? Why did i not go with my mom?.. i was just a child.. i just wanted to be loved...he said it was my birthday gift.. 

Ever since then no matter how happy my birthdays are.. the whole month i just have awful mood swings and everything and anything comes bubbling up...
I try extra hard to make them special and good but it still just sits in the back of my mind

I hate the way the spring air feels in my lungs, the smells and the way the light changes

I dont even know where he lived really.. but everytime i get close to it i can feel it in my bones.
I can just know it. Anytime i see someone that even vaguely looks like him i feel 11 again. 

I wish i could burn him alive and watch the ashes take away all that he did to me. 
I wish i could tell his parents what they did and watch their faces. 

I wish i could just prove what he did to me and look him in the eye and know he can never do it again.

939,1,"in late january, i (24F) was involved in an extremely traumatic car accident in which my car rolled over after being hit by another car going at least 55 mph. the impact was major, my car (an SUV) was completely totaled, all windows but one shattered, when i tell you i’ll never forget the smell and sound of crashing windows and metal… i miraculously walked out of the accident unscathed after being saved by two amazing bystanders that got me out of my car (i was hanging upside down, thank god for seatbelts) with only minor bruising, whiplash and cuts. after the accident, i wasn’t really even scared (adrenaline!) and was just relieved and thankful to be alive after such an insane accident. nobody could believe that i was walking, let alone alive. 

fast forward to now, and im struggling to do just about everything in my life. i sit and hide away in my room all day when im not working. i have debilitating anxiety going to places that are even just down the road. every time i drive i get triggered and flashbacks to the incident, and the triggers are so intense i get full body physical and mental reactions (heart palpitations, blurred vision, feeling disconnected from reality). before my accident i was focused on my health, eating good and exercising everyday and just genuinely being the happiest i ever was in my life. this accident took that all away from me. i denied my feelings of trauma after the crash and kept telling myself that these feelings would pass, but i feel like it’s actually getting worse with time. i’m so incredibly depressed. 

i know i need to see a therapist but the thought of finding and actually driving to a therapist makes me feel sick. i just feel so helpless and don’t know what to do and how to cope. 

how do you guys manage your ptsd? does it really ever get better, or do you just get better at managing it? what’s your experience with ptsd like? open to any and all advice. thank you all:)"
940,1,"it’s been 7 months since the event and events that have me severe ptsd.  yesterday, it started again.  I went through a month of unbearable nausea and it literally almost killed me.  I don’t think I can do it again.  I’m seriously considering suicide just to escape having to go through that all again"
941,3,"I (53m) have been with my boyfriend (60m) who I'll call A, for a few years now. We're both cops and went into this relationship knowing the other has a lot of trauma. Recently A hasn't been doing well.  He's diagnosed autistic and with PTSD, and recently things have gotten worse. 

A recently worked on a case involving somebody he served with in the military, and it triggered his PTSD badly. He hasn't been sleeping really, nor eating (though that was always a struggle). When A does sleep it triggers nightmares and/or flashbacks. 

I'm not sure what to do. Usually we use sex as a coping mechanism, but it doesn't seem to be working anymore. Any advice is welcomed. "
942,2,"I recently began therapy to process when I was forced to have sex (can’t use the R word yet) in a pretty brutal way in college 10 years ago. I’ve been repressing all my memories / emotions of the event since then. Since I’ve begun speaking about it I’ve been having distressing feelings about what happened but don’t really remember the emotions / thoughts I was having / physical pain that occurred that night. It’s mostly just glimpses of the people in the room, a cold cup in my hand, laughter etc. I’m hoping my brain didn’t encode the physical pain / emotions and that’s why I can’t really remember. I’m curious if other people have no memories of pain in their experiences - I’m honestly really scared to remember that piece."
943,1,"I gotta say it's been just over a year since I lost someone really close to me. The closest actually. And I can't believe im still as fucked up as I am. Before I was already kinda anti social, but now... I still can't speak right when I talk to people, I can't say things clearly or say the words when I want to, just overall lack of whatever there idek. And with feelings it's like im thinking of everything all at once or I just feel empty and dead so much. I don't know how to fix it. If he knew how much this messed me up he'd probly be dissapointed in me but I just don't know how to be normal. Like sometimes im good at pretending but it's exhausting and it feels like im this whole other person. The flashbacks and that have gotten slightly better, but even then I feel like I'm crazy for stil crying just at the thought of em. Does anyone else feel like they'll never be who they once were again?...."
944,2,"So my new therapist was explaining different modalities to me so we could try and figure out which one would be best. I had warned her that biblical counseling (the thing where my ptsd stems from) was structured a lot like cbt therapy, so I assumed that would be a bad fit for me, but was open to talk about it.

Sure enough, the moment she started discussing how the session would start by discussing homework and whatnot from the previous week, I was lost to the rest of the therapy session. It reminded me *so much* of biblical counseling, except I do genuinely believe that my therapist would be giving me real choices instead of the fake choices I'd been given. But not like my body could believe that.

After that I was hot and dizzy, completely dissociated, and was doing mild self harm behavior to try and snap out of it. 

Honestly I should have stopped my therapist and told her I wasn't fully processing anything else she was saying, but i let her explain the other modalities  and such, and I think we decided on EMDR, but I'm not sure."

946,1,"Hózhǫ́

Do you practise it?
I try — and it’s challenging. I work on it every day — but I fail. I fail to find even a semblance of balance. My soul is steadfastly unsettled.

“In beauty I walk.
With beauty before me, I walk.
With beauty behind me, I walk.
With beauty above me, I walk.
With beauty around me, I walk.”

But I walk in darkness — restless.

Perhaps this is why I take the view I do about hope: a soul unsettled will not see hope.

And I’ve seen hope extinguished too — hundreds of times. Faces all melded together.

A poor hajji downrange once tried to call out to our patrol, but his strength was gone. You could see in his eyes, even at a distance, that he knew he was dying, and that his faith had all but left him. He was afraid. There was no cry of Allahu Akbar, no steady gaze, no turn toward Qibla. You could see that he didn’t believe in God or life after death — that this was the end for him. That he would never see his family again — or whisper the azan when his grandson is born, or hear his bacha lovingly utter baba jan again. Like a grain of khak caught in the wind — spinning, and then eventually vanishing. 

You could see in his eyes that he knew we could’ve saved him if we’d wanted to — a little suppression fire here, a call for a Nine Line there, nothing too difficult — but we left him to die. The chow line was about to start, and none of us wanted to miss it. We left him to the incompetence of the ANA. 

And you could see in his eyes, before he passed, that he just didn’t understand.

That is hope extinguished.

In darkness I lay.
With dust before me, I lay.
With blood behind me, I lay.
With nothingness above me, I lay.
With indifference around me, I lay.

947,2,   How do I deal with flashbacks without them ruining my mood almost entirely or just getting stuck in them ?
948,1,"Just having a rough time right now. Flashbacks and intrusive thoughts. Feeling very down, very distracted at work.



I am so disappointed in myself because I felt for a while that I had been doing so well. Even when I was sad or down, it was because of other things not bc of The Big Bad Trauma and I had been proud of myself that it had been affecting me less lately, that I've been more stable. This feels like a massive step back.



I just feel like I'm in such a dark place again. And it's so lonely here.



I hate having these thoughts, these physical sensations, these feelings, these nightmares. And I feel so alone in it. I've learned not to confide in friends about this anymore. And while I think it does make me more likeable, it does make me feel more alone.



Anyone else?"
949,3,"TL:DR (I ended up hitting a pedestrian and am looking for advice/Support)

Hello. I am a 20 year old who was involved in a crash which took someone’s life. I feel immense guilt and shame for what I have done. I look at myself as murderer and am not sure how to deal with the emotional turmoil.

In December of 2024 I was driving to my friends house after work something that i usually do. It was around 9p after a big storm and as i was driving it was sprinkling. After passing a traffic light i had seen something in the middle turn lane about 30 yards out but i couldn’t make out exactly what it was. At first it looked like a puddle or some trash so i  proceeded with a little bit of caution but didn’t pay it any mind. when i was about to past this object in the road i suddenly heard a big boom and my windshield was cracked. I was lost at first pulled over looking for what i had hit and saw a woman laying in the road. It clicked that I had hit this woman.

I was shocked at but after processing what just happened i had picked up and dragged to the sidewalk. It was a busy street so others had seen the crash and luckily and off duty paramedic was right in the sidewalk and seen the crash. She immediately started performing CPR while me and about 3 others called 911.

Paramedics and fire fighters came within 10 minutes and took her to the hospital which was 15 minutes away. I was petrified but hopeful she would make it, I checked her pulse when I laid her on the sidewalk and felt a rhythmic but feint pulse. I was questioned and gave police to the best of my knowledge every detail i could. About 15 minutes after the crash the Woman’s family showed up and they were clearly and obviously distraught. Me and those who seen the crash had to stay while the crash was investigating. Then homicide unit came.

I was questioned again by a detective and after being questioned I asked if the woman was stable and he had told me she passed and that it’ll take 1-3 months before knowing exactly what will happen to me. 

3 months later the detective had called me to say I was not found guilty of the crash. Though legally I was found to not be guilty I can’t help to feel like I could have done more to help the woman. How does one get over taking a life? 


 "
950,3,"I’m in need of some support. I’ve been diagnosed with C-PTSD for about 6 years now. It’s so bad that it actually causes me to have non-epileptic seizures. I’ve been going through  EMDR therapy to regain control of my body and I’ve been doing better. However, Saturday night I had a horrible flash back of a repressed memory after finding and holding my childhood blanket. I was very young in the memory and it was very disturbing. Ever since, I’ve felt almost catatonic. I’m very disassociated and on edge. I’ve called off work the past two days which I feel very guilty about. All I want to do is sleep. My next EMDR appt isn’t until Thursday and talk therapy isn’t until Sunday. I feel like I’m falling apart and it doesn’t help that when I’m around my roommates (4 of them) I’m trying to pretend like nothing is wrong. 

I’m drowning here. "
951,2,"Since 8 years old (Now 17) I’ve had A LOT of trauma. Everywhere I go no matter what I do something traumatic happens. 

I’ve been bullied (sometimes physically beat up),raped (got pregnant and had a miscarriage from it at 14), seen people die/almost die, someone attempted to kidnap me, someone tried to murder me and I saw that same person try to murder someone else. And probably more I’m missing out. 

Most of those things sound unreal. Like things you’d see in a horror movie but would never happen to you. I only know a few people who have  gone though trauma. Most of them from a special needs school I went to so that checks out. But the majority of people go through like with little to no trauma. And that makes me feel confused. Like how did I go through all of this? Like not just one or two things but CONSTANTLY everywhere I go something bad happens. How could that happen to me but most people get to be safe? 

And the people in the special school as well. Most of them had multiple traumatic things happen to them. Why did it happen to us? 

I met kids there who got bullied,raped,abused,pregnant young,witnessed people dying too some of them multiple of these too and I’m sure more I wasn’t told about. LIKE HOW? Like genuinely why did it have to happen to us? I don’t get how statistically it’s possible for all of the evil of the world to be subjected to a few people while most of society goes their whole life without those extreme things happening?

My mental state about this has gotten really bad. I sometimes even question if anything is real. Like maybe my whole life is fake. Maybe none of this and no one is real. 

Sometimes I feel this is all some sort of sick game. I’ve had delusions that god is punishing me for something. Telling everyone to hurt me. It feels like the whole world is collectively against me except the people with trauma. Because they’re getting punished too ig. Like I don’t get how everyone seems to be against me. I didn’t do anything wrong. I don’t know why everyone wants to hurt me. And why everyone wants to hurt them."
952,2,I'm an adult and I still live with my family because of depression and anxiety and my family makes it so much worse because they're borderline abusive. The other day I was trying to sleep and my sister was making noise with her mobile phone. Certain sounds cause panic for me and I was begging her to stop but she wouldn't listen. I have a lot of social anxiety so it's hard for me to argue with other people and it made me feel so so bad and abused and disrespected. Every time I remember all these things I get a mental breakdown. I don't know how to tell someone because I feel like no one is gonna take me seriously since people think PTSD is just r*pe or war. I'm on medication but it's not helping me. I don't know how to tell my doctor. All these things are making my social anxiety so much worse. I wish I could move out and isolate to feel a little safer but that's impossible when I'm so depressed I can't function.
953,1,"So the reason why I think I trauma dump or am now at least aware of it is because as I heal I never got to talk to my siblings about what was happening or able to tell my parents what was going on. My forbid us from talking to each other about things that were going on in our house. We never got to talk about the trauma we all suffered until later in life which was extremely detrimental to all of us. I never developed boundaries and I didn’t understand them when it came to other people and if I did have boundaries I came from a house where no one respected mine so I guess in turn I didn’t respect others.

I was a very quiet kid who I now see kept a lot inside. I was extremely and still am socially awkward. I didn’t have much of an outlet and whoever thought wanted to listen I would share things with whether it’d be good or bad or appropriate or not appropriate. I just wanted to be social and heard I guess.
For those I overshared with I’m extremely sorry. It was never my intention to make you feel uncomfortable at all and if I knew what I know now I would have respected your boundaries. Boundaries are something I’m just now learning about and I’m starting to make myself.

The thing I hate about boundaries are you don’t know everyone’s boundaries going into a conversation and you only learn afterwards that you crossed a line with sharing a trauma experience, mental health issue or etc afterwards. This leaves the person who shared awful and full of guilt. If we knew that you would be triggered we would not share but through no fault of their own or our own we don’t know until it’s been said.

I find that all of us seem to suffer from things and I wish instead of labeling things as “toxic” or any other hurtful term we just come together and try our best to meet people where they are and if you are uncomfortable simply say “I wish I could help but this makes me feel uncomfortable” or something along those lines. I know for me if someone told me that now I would respect them and understand. I have had people I’ve talked to go behind my back after sharing something private and extremely vulnerable with them only to be told later by my boss or someone else that I made that person uncomfortable when I wish that person would have told me in person. This person I would share stuff with never said anything to me and is someone I considered a friend. Then one day to be pulled in the office like I did something wrong hurt. I lost trust with this person because she never gave me a chance to at least apologize and she went behind my back and talked about me. It’s things like this not need to stop. The person sharing is not trying to re-traumatize you at all. They don’t know your backstory they are looking for someone to talk to and listen to them. We are looking for understanding. I know for me I just want to be vulnerable and feel what I’m feeling and be validated from someone else that I have a right to feel the way I feel. Validation is something I never experienced as a kid and as I heal I want validation but in doing so I tend to over share not to be malicious or anything like that because I just am looking to be heard and I’m trying to come out of my shell.

I wish communication amongst all of us was better and if it’s one thing I want this world to embrace or do better with is communication. I’m not asking you to carry my cross I’m just looking for compassion and camaraderie that so many of us never experience in this life. We all are to share each other’s burdens and to be here for one another but that can only happen if we are honest with each other. Now do I believe some people can abuse all this absolutely but the majority of us are looking for human interaction and to get out of our heads.

Please whether you are the person being vented too or you are the venting person please be honest with each other and if things are uncomfortable please go tell them don’t go behind the persons back because it causes more pain. It might be uncomfortable but it allows each person to understand and to respect each other’s boundaries. Also please know not all of us are looking for special treatment or anything we are simply looking for what we never had. We are looking to heal and to come out of our shell. We are looking to be vulnerable again and to feel what was never felt before. Please be patient with us and for us trauma individuals please be patient with them. We should love each other and understand each other but that can only happen if we are vulnerable together.

954,2,"I was just wondering. Have been trying to figure out my brain, and some of the same terms keep coming up. Prefrontal cortex, dopamine, anxiety, sleep, depression, to me there seems to be quite an overlap of PTSD and some of these conditions mentioned above. I have hit a very high score on the adhd test, and depression as well, and always been wondering if those come from the CPTSD or would have been there anyways, especially the ADHD.

So just wondering, how about you?"
955,2,"What happens to everyone before a flashback? And what ways do you find it best to cope?

For some context, about 6 months ago I was involved in a serious medical incident where unfortunately the person involved passed away. Since then, I have been mostly coping well, however recently I keep having periods of what can only be described as disassociation before inevitably feeling as though I am having a flashback? My heart rate increases and it feels as though I am almost engulfed by what happened, and my thoughts and mental images are only that. Like the pre-existing thoughts just intensify tenfold. It feels like I can’t escape, and my brain is tricking myself to tell me I’m still there. Afterwards, it’s like a switch is flicked and I’m somewhat confused. It’s like I need reassurance to confirm what I already know.

The issue is, I’m not quite sure what to do to stop this once I get to the disassociation stage, since it always seems to bite me in the arse anyways. Any advice on coping with this? I find it really hard to speak to other people about what I went through so I thought this was worth a shot."

Before that I had a lot of success with the ladys
Both physical and  mental 
Now I'm feeling like someone else
I think that with all that's going on in the social media
Girls really wanting someone healthy and with money
Or someone that will take care of tham.. 

I look preety good
I play  electric guitar pretty good 
I think I have a lot to offer in terms of love and conversation 
But because of my illness I feel that I am not good enough
Any of you has the same/close issues with 
The whole dating/relationship world? "
957,3,"Hi, im in the uk firstly so some advice may be different /more relevant.

Ive got ptsd, but due to having multiple chronic illnesses and also being someone  with adhd and autism, im finding it impossible to get help with ptsd. This is from multiple sources from childhood to recent years(im 40). 

I have to have so many medical appointments, procedures, tests that im just burnt out, and both dealing with the traumatic events and actually getting someone to help me with them is daunting and seems impossible.

My gp told me they had reffered me to councelling specifically for Ptsd over a year ago. During this time i kept asking about the referral, and i was constantly told each time it had been done and that i had to just wait. 

Eventually i found out the referral was never sent in the first place with no explanation. Im sick of living like this and would really like some meaningful help (ive had many many sessions of cbt, useless for me and these issues). Who exactly should i be trying to see and talk to? My gp is the 4th worst in the county so im fighting against my own issues and that aspect too. 

I am literally unable to feel happy out of fear something awful will happen or that ive done something wrong or upset someone, or that when people are being nice to me it cant be real. Ive lost a prior marriage to this, friends, relationships, the bond i had with my daughter and i really want to try to be better. "
958,1,"7 years ago I told my doctor that life felt like a sports match that I was losing. The wealthier is bad, my team is down on points and it’s the second half. I’m not gonna quit, but I’m ready for the game to be over.

The lead to years of trying different medications and lots of therapy. Meds never helped, therapy is where I repeatedly diagnosed with ptsd. By the 3rd therapist, I decided to actually take the idea seriously.

I am currently doing fine. Life is ok. Nothing crazy going on. I still have bad days, but I’m better at seeing them come up and knowing what helps. I’ve made a few good choices to put myself in a better space. It’s paid off.

If I were to give another sport analogy to explain how I currently feel, I think it has been a rough marathon for several years. I’m winning so far, but barely. It’s hard living a few steps ahead of something chasing you. Staying in that mental space is kind of exhausting."
959,1,"My mom is a narcissist and I finally wrote her a letter. I actually feel weird and sick after writing it. I'm cutting her out like I cut out my sister. I wanted to post the letter but I don't know if that's too much.  

I'm going to have to have my husband read it. He happily offered to deliver it and explain why to her.

Edit: here is the letter 

Mom - 

After months of thinking, talking with *husband * and my therapist and psychiatrist, I have decided to cut contact with you as well. The moment that really pushed this decision to the surface was when I told you (via text) that I had cancer; your response was a 'thumbs up' emoji. The level of uncaring disrespect I felt at that moment really changed how I felt about our relationship. Throughout the whole diagnosis, surgery, and recovery you were not available in any meaningful way. You never came over to see how I was doing, you called yeah, but nothing else. And even then, you talked about yourself/your surgeries. The brothers and sisters (in my congregation ) did far more for me than you even attempted to do. 

Another example of disrespect was for my bridal shower. You were asked to make the cupcakes but you waited until the last second and didn't even have them decorated until after you came to the venue, they were supposed to be served when you got there. I was standing in the kitchen crying and begging you to finish them; you had let me down again, and it was such a simple task. You did the same to my wedding cake. Instead of saying you couldn't do it or didn't want too, you instead decorated the cake (which I baked for you to make it easier on you) in a horrible manner nothing like I asked because you didn't plan properly, you were too into making sure your appearance was going to be perfect; it's all you talked about. 

In regards to the issue between *narc sister* and I, you have not once asked for my side of the story. You have asked me to apologize to *narc sister* without any work of trying to hear both sides, I'm the problem here to you. The feeling of being the one blamed for *narc sister* (and even *brothers*) actions is not new to me, it's been ongoing for my whole life. You have wanted me to “keep the peace” when you should have been the parent and punished the correct child. 

I know you're thinking I should be appreciative of what you have done, and I am. I'm grateful you did my makeup for my wedding. I'm grateful you were able to drive me to places when I needed to as well. But the things I 'should' be appreciative of are no where near the amount of emotional neglect, disrespect, dishonesty, and pain you have caused in the last 38 years. 

So I am asking you please give me space. If I feel I'm in a place to reach out, I will. If there is some kind of emergency, reach out to *husband*; you won't be able to reach me. 

Thank you. "
960,2,"Hi guys. I'm not diagnosed but feel like sharing here maybe it will help. 

A decade ago I did something stupid which ended up online and I got severely ripped apart for it. I regret the thing I did for sure but it felt like the punishment was so disproportionate. I had hundreds of people telling me I should die, get cancer, joking about bombing my house etc. I had a news reporter and photographer waiting outside my house, was named and shamed in a tabloid and written about online. I felt like a complete monster. 

It really really really messed me up. My worst fear is something like that happening again and I'll go over everything I've done, every mistake and convince myself it will come back to get me. I still freak out if my phone rings from an unknown number and hate reading or watching anything that has anything to do with people being shamed or punished.

961,2,"Hey everyone. I (18F) should start by saying by I **DON'T** have a PTSD diagnosis, but have been living with PTSD-like symptoms for over a year. I went to therapy targeting 🍇 trauma a few times but am still really struggling. I am wondering if you have found PTSD diagnosis worth it, since the process of getting diagnosed seems so terrifying for me and makes it real.

Since I have a job and am in university currently, maybe having a diagnosis of PTSD would be helpful in getting accommodations since I'm too scared to go back to therapy. I am already diagnosed with MDD and GAD but the process for those were much simpler and are more common diagnoses.

I would also continue to keep this a secret from my family which could be difficult and instead just talk to friends, colleagues and some teachers I still stay in contact with."
962,1,"I hope this is an okay place to post this. Honestly, I would love some kind words/support as though my family and partner and very kind and understanding, they can’t relate in any way, and I don’t want to upset them either! 

When I was 21 (I’m 23 now) I saw a 12 year old girl get stabbed in the neck. I was the first person who went over to this massive group of 12-15 year olds to try and help and they were all screaming at me to help them while this poor little girl lay on the concrete, bleeding heavily. I called the ambulance for them and stayed until it arrived, but I watched the girl who got stabbed get progressively whiter and whiter, then go into cardiac arrest all while we were trying to save her, but the injury was just too severe. She died only an hour later in the hospital. I was kept around by police interviewing me on what happened for a while, but ended up having to go back to a station to give a statement the next day. When I got home that night I realised I had her blood all over my boots.

This was 2 years ago and I still think of her every day. I've done some therapy, but I still struggle sometimes. I always feel as if I could have done more and maybe if I'd have gotten there quicker, she might not have died. 

I was doing okay with the memories, they didn’t distress me like they used to, but for some reason they’re coming back a lot right now. I keep jolting awake at night thinking of her and it makes me panic. The guilt I feel is tremendous, I should have done more but I was so scared."
963,2,"Hey guys , so here’s the thing , 5 years ago I was at this park I always went to since I lived in neighborhood near it and I would always go there when I got a lot on my mind or just need to be always from people , anyways on this specific day I went to park because I was going thru it with the girl i was with at the time need to just think , well as I’m siting on the swings texting her , 2 young teens come up me asking questions like who am I and if the car was mine (it’s was my moms car ) and asking me if my chains was real , i felt the vibe and I knew I had to get out of there , one then goes on talking to me saying “you could beat our asa huh” ofc I was I said no , they just kids and and tried to be cool with him but then he started rambling about how he just got out of jail and stuff and the person he was with had a lil bag , well as the teen talks to be he said wanted to show me something and I already knew what it was , so I as I seen pull out the gun my instinct was to try to get ( I know this was stupid but he hadn’t putten in the mag yet so I thought I had a chance) well I was too slow because as soon as I step up and try , he steps back 2 times by this time he already loaded it , and points at me , I told him no to do it , and next thing i remember I was shot on the floor bleeding , they must ran after the first shot must gotten scared idk.luckily my body reacted before getting shot moving my stance so instead of it hitting my chest it got my arm( I believe it was god who saved me ) 
After that idk I just felt like a part of me was gone , like the courage I once had is gone and gotten really paranoid, but as years went by I started to feel more comfortable to go out again .a lot of you may say why didn’t I go to police , well to be honest with you , I was worried that, it would affect me people calling me a snitch or nothing would be done,so I left it gods hands , as I was hospital I did find out who it’s was ( you see once someone does something stupid , the first thing they do is go on internet and brag ) my friends were heated (meaning pissed) wanted to do something but I told them it’s not worth it , in end that’s how wars start ,you do something to one groups and other retaliates and it’s never ending cycle. So I left at that , I didn’t think it was going affect me the way it did. As for teen well I know he was in and out of jail or juvie, so I kinda thought he would stay there but I was wrong .

I thought I gotten over everything after years and I was no longer scared but man after seeing him again after years , all the feelings started to rush back the anxiety the paranoia,I know that maybe he doesn’t even remember me probably just thinks it was failed robbery but still , I believe he is still a malicious and evil as ever. Honesty I just want to know what i should do or can do ? Idk in weird mind space rn .
Thanks you all for reading and listening I appreciate it it’s feels like weight has been somewhat lifted ."
964,2,"I just want help and clarify what is going on with me. In my childhood and teens years I was witnessed domestic abuse from my father to my mom. And I myself was an emotional abuser in my previous relationship. But already few years I cannot stand when in the street some men behave themselves violent toward women. I was witnessed how man beat woman to her face and I immediately intervene. And it was first time when I was almost assaulted. But there was some similar situations in the past, but not that intimidating. There was three defining situations when I was intimidate and beaten because I intervene to conflict and extreme situations. And after last of such situation I barely able to go outside, because I have so much fear that I may again be in such situation and I doubt myself that I’m be able to protect victims of abuse. I fear a tiny scream from the streets and my heart is pounding and when I’m outside or at work in casino I always on the alert.

What do you think it’s something similar to PTSD? Or maybe it’s some different thing?

I know that nobody here can diagnose me, but I just want to share my story. Thank you and I’m sorry for my english!"
965,3,"“the greatest feeling a human being knows is to feel needed.”
is that why i so desperately give and give and give? i’m at my wits’ end. i’m broke. i do so so much for the people around me and never feel needed or even seen. so, that’s my question: is giving to others (money, time, transportation, gifts, etc.) a trauma response?

"
966,2,"For the past few months ive had this gut feeling that ive been sexually abused at what i think at around age 5-6 but i have no visual memory of it. I have a lot of the symptoms but cant be too sure, like i have emotional flashbacks quite frequently butt when on a family trip ,i was  sat next to the person i think did it to me, i got the biggest flashback or most intense but idk if its cuz of that. I also have very very poor memory of my childhood mainly before the age of 9 and  i know that as a kid ive always felt ""weird"" around men but i cant evem describe that but i dont understand it myself. Im also extremely hypervigilant and cynical to the point where i cant enjoy myself, like in public im scared someone is following me all the time and in shops i feel like ppl r plotting to traffic me etc. I also know that as a kid i used to be rly interest in looking at rape cases it wud terrify me but i wud still look into them, they were like v nostalgic or i was either just a very empathetic child lol. And when i was 10 there was a period of time where i was scared of men and wudnt go outside for like a month ish but i think its cuz i looked at all them cases imao, the person who i suspect did it to me is my auntys husband idk y but like ive been told i was v close to him as a child and he is nicer to me than any of my other cousins but idk, wht i also find weird is that i absolutely LOATHE the touch of my mother even tho i think she did nothing, its mainly when she touches my back, i get extemely angry and can almost hit her i hate it but then i start crying i hate being touched only by  her. I also have some sensory issues (i think?) As in like im scared of loud noises such as toilet flushing and hairdryer  and i hate being surrounded by like dark colours
There are a few more symptoms but this is all i cud think of off the top of my head, does anyone know wht i cud do or y i feel like this? Is there a way to make the memories come back?"
967,2,"I 16M developed PTSD when I was 12 because of severe bullying, I changed schools and everything seemed alright fine until the symptoms began showing up, after that It became unbearable to even socialize because of It. I can't hold friendships long enough because everything and everyone is a threat to me, I won't let myself be vulnerable again, and even the minor details make me scared and reactive, half of my ex-friends are mad at me because of my reactions to possible threats, and when I localize one, I go crazy and loose control, I am currently on meds but changing them isn't really possible at the time right now, what do I do?"

"
969,1,"Well I'm 26 yo, I've been in therapy for 4 years.

Currently I'm with a new therapist and I started microdosing lsd (on her supervision), I know it will help me because it did it last time, but now I'm in a space of mental breakdown and it's hard to resist suicidal thoughts.

After my last relationship I had a bad breakdown and I am currently feeling terrible after 3 months of endless pain, flashbacks, nightmares, bad sleep and dissociation.

I'm hardly keeping my job, I'm always sick (I had scabies 3 times, now I got the flu just when I needed some strength to recover and I feel like I fell even harder down again), I can't really take care of myself, my health, basic daily care and wellbeing, I'm hardly getting out of my home, I feel numb and dissociated, I fell back hard into my porn addiction and my new therapist seems not to understand how bad the situation is.

I am to a point in which I'm actually considering it, I don't know if I'll do it, but my life now feels like an endless array of pain, and I know it won't always be like that, but the thought of having to be very active and do a lot of work, A LOT, like the last times just to fall back and start again it's making me going insane.

I'm tired of getting back to point zero every time. Therapy did nothing honestly since after 4 years I am still here.

Back to point zero, less than zero, having to start all fucking over again and again and again and again and again. I feel stuck in life and I feel I cannot remove these blocks.

I don't even care of what I'm doing right now, sitting in my office, after having masturbated 4 times risking getting caught, posting on Reddit with work having to be done which I procrastinated for weeks, I literally want to get up, destroy this computer, take my car, go really really far and sleep in my car without eating or calling nobody for days, I might as well leave my phone here, and maybe I won't come back. I don't need anything as long as I'm not starving: no fucking money from nobody, no fucking anything, nothing, they won't get me as long as I don't starve. And you can be a long time without eating.

I don't want to see a computer ever anymore in my life. I don't want a smartphone, an internet connection, I don't want to see a single piece of hardware capable of connecting to internet which is not an ebook reader.

I know I can't take care of myself and people around me cannot either, I'm just thrown into the world as it is, without nobody, without myself.

Maybe I will not take my life but I can leave, alone as I am, and uncapable of being alone at the same time. I don't care if they fire me, I don't care if people around me get worried because I cannot see any value in them nor in myself, I do not care about my stuff and my belongings. Shit I'm back to a point where if I don't take my life is just because my family will suffer too much because of it, and I promised myself back that it wouldn't happen ever again, and it happened again."
970,2,"I had surgery by the NHS the worst part is that is was a biopsy on the head of my penis and I wasn't numbed properly so I screamed and screamed and screamed and my whole body was wrenching upwards but the surgeon didn't stop.

Now I've got PTSD and a phobia of numbing injections but I think after numerous incompetent unprofessional experiences with the NHS I think the NHS now triggers my main PTSD so I really don't know what to do.

It's so bad I think that even if I killed myself I would end up in my head being on that surgery table screaming in unimaginable pain.

Any suggestions?"

I felt the covers go up and he lifted up my underwear so I moved to the side again. covers stayed lifted up and I thibk he took photos of me. I'm currently still at his house and idk whst to do. idk if it counts as sa and idk if I should reach out or do anything about it. he's been my pal for about a year now but I don't feel comfortable coming over to his anymore."
973,2,"Well, hi. This think flooded in my mind for a long long time, and I don’t know who am I — man w ptsd or pervert. 

I can’t help myself, I desired to thought of being raped. Idk why. I want so badly sometimes to be nailed rough and raw, by bunch of men. And ok, u may say — bro this is porn culture (frats and smth shit like gaycest) 
But this thoughts has place in my mind even when I was 13 yo(I’m 26 now). 
I didn’t have male friends back there, and now I have just one, str8 dude, he is like my older brother. And I don’t want to have sex w him, cuz this friendship feels like something real good. 
I have a terrible relationship w my dad, he is an alcoholic and abuser. He tortured my mother by raping her, gaslighting and locked her in the asylum. 
He told me since I was a child — u r faggot and sissy. But I wasn’t. I was just a child. I hated him so much, but at the same time I wanted him to be my father. I was jealous, saw how other boys have this sacred dad-son bond. How dads reached their sons, believed in them and etc. I don’t have a dad, like, this man, he isn’t my dad in full meaning of this word.

And I don’t know. Sometimes I think that if some frat boys fucked me hard, it would bond me with them, like, make me they brother. I definitely see in this rough “gaycest” stuff something like — oh he is just my wall, he is protecting me…. U know 
 
When I was 20yo, I was actually raped. But this is wierd situation. I met two guys from Grindr, and they were older, then they said. Like plus 10 years to them profile-age 
And I didn’t know what to do, cuz I already was at their place. So this two not so good looking man, 40-45yo, convinced me to stay for a while, just for chill out. And watch movie ofc. The first sec of the movie and they grab me, throw me on the carpet and took me by force, when I prayed them to stop, they just shout me w d’s. After that they said that it was fun, “we should do it again sometimes”… and they convinced me, that this is not big deal, just cool rough sex. …

Idk why, but this episode of my life doesn’t bothered me. But I can’t talk about a lot in details… so. 
Yeah, in this “rape” “gaycest” “locker room fun/frats” I see a lot of masculinity, like I became a MAN, like I’m the part of this society. I think the sex is cheap stuff, and dull. But this bond is wow… but I also understand — this is sick, this isn’t normal stuff for me. Idk bros. "

I (19F) recently experienced some stalking from my ex boyfriend (19M) who showed up my house, sent me emails from new accounts, etc. it didn’t threaten my life or anything but I’ve been so on edge recently, so unfocused and it really bothers me that it happened. I tried to be civil with him but I ended up blocking him again because having him in my texts made me so anxious. I have trouble falling asleep at night and I’m curious whether or not these symptoms could be related??"

Any ideas how to get unstuck? "
978,2,Is anyone else a survivor of sexual abuse and in a loving partnership with a supportive person & wants to be degraded / hurt during sex& feels shame about this ? Did this improve with therapy? Or did you just embrace it as part of you ? 
979,2,"  I feel so guilty like i deserved this somehow and if I didn't, i definitely did for ignoring red flags and wanting to believe he was still a good guy. For letting my feelings blind me. For not wanting to believe he'd do anything even though he was making me so uncomfortable.

  What's worse though is the shame and humiliation. That this even happened at all. People probably blame me. I bet they secretly judge me. I bet they don't believe it was that bad, or that I really didn't want sex. I wonder if they're secretly thinking I must be really stupid, but I'm not.

  Just when it came to him...... I liked him. Just because I wasn't wanting sex doesn't mean I didn't like him. And I feel humiliated about that too. How I could still like him. How i could still forgive him....... not that i forgave him cuz personally I had to, but how it's not even that hard to forgive him now that i understand him.

  Of course i already kinda did understand him. Of course im still going to grieve like not remembering this for so long....... for so long he wasn't my ""rapist"". 

  He was my ex boyfriend .  "

986,1,"This is really my first time sharing any of the horror I went through with my ex. Which was 15+ years ago. 
I (35 F). Met my ex Mike (maybe a 40M) about 15 years ago. I was working at a bar in our very small town in Texas as a cocktail waitress when he came in. I was not old enough to even drink at the time but was heavily into drugs and alcohol. Mainly hydrocodone and whatever else I could get my hands on. He came into the bar I was working in at the time and there was nothing about him that stood out other than he paid me the most attention. After I few nights of him at the bar I finally agreed to go “home” with him. His home was a run down trailer parked in the shadiest side of our small Texas town. That first night was great and fun to be the center of attention for someone, I remember mikes small travel trailer lost power at some point during my first night there and we made the absolute most out of it. But before to long (I guess because I have repressed most of it) my next memory is us living together there and him wailing a broom at my head. I don’t know but I stilled stayed after that. After he threw the broom at me we ended up in the front yard and he full body tackled me. I called my sister who thankfully picked me up and was able to get the 2 small fractures treated to my wrist. But even after that I still went back. We eventually got an apartment together in Portland Tx and from there the abuse just skyrocketed. We had a lot of little dogs at the time and I know Mike was under immense pressure. Because we were both addicts we didn’t know how to care for each other. There were many “fights” but the one I remember the most was when I got home and there was dog shit everywhere in our apartment. I was so disappointed that he couldn’t even take our dogs out- a fight ensued and Mikey rubbed the dog shit in my mouth. He then choked me until our downstairs neighbor called the police. Then he took off and I believe the PD caught him and took him to jail. But I writes all of this to say that now I am so happily married to a wonderful man with 2 beautiful boys- but these moods come up in me. Where I want to know what happened to him. I want to confront him and I want answers to why he treated me this way. I don’t know what to do"
987,2,"i witnessed a violent murder at my workplace a week ago. i am trying to work up the courage to go back to work. i want to be strong and brave and do it but every time i think about it i get so anxious. i have never experienced this before and i don’t know what to do.
"
988,2,"I constantly read about how people with ptsd avoid any kind of horror content, especially when it could contain triggers, and especially when it contains jump scares. But I've found that to just not be true for me, the opposite actually. During my worst ptsd times, I would just. Constantly be watching horror movies, or play horror games. The more jump scares, the better. I guess it kind of gave me a sense of being able to control something that gave me intense fear and/or panic? Idk. But I feel so.. Wrong when other people with ptsd don't do similar things. Like I can't have ptsd if I do that, or that I am wrong and messed up because of it, like a freak of nature I guess. Doesn't really make sense that you can do ptsd wrong but that's what I feel like

So, does anyone else experience this? Or is this just a(nother) fcked up speciality my brain cooked up? 
Would be very grateful for any insights

989,0,"I went for a walk today. It's one of the first truly beautiful days of the season in Minnesota. 

It made me think of when I was a kid living on the farm. My mom used to set me and my sister loose and tell us to ""go play."" We'd run around for hours with the cows in the pasture or chase barn swallows and catch the poor things with our hands. Eventually, our parents would find us asleep in some tree or wherever we finally ran out of steam.

We moved to the Twin Cities in 1996 when my parents split and life became drastically different, but it still brings me peace when I think of those little moments. I've lived a lot of lives since then, but everytime I look up at the clouds in Springtime, I remember the little version of me that used to chase them until I was out of breath."
990,0,"When I was a kid I went through a lot of traumatic stuff that I never got any help with. But the weird thing is is that i'm competely normal and never had any side affects from it. Like even the day after I wasn't sad or anything, literally just the same person i've always been. And even though I never had any therapy or anything help with this stuff I have no symptoms of trauma, I'm able to keep relationships, don't struggle with any emotional regulation issues, and I have no feelings about what happened to me. Like when I think about it I don't even have any emotions, they didn't impact my life in really any way which is weird because they impacted the people around me who went through some of the stuff I went through a lot. Honestly it pretty much feels like it didn't even happen and I could care less about it. I'm literally just like ""it is what it is"" and then carry on like nothing ever happened. Am I just extremely lucky? Why am I like this, im just curios cause I think about it a lot but like I don't even care like theres literally no emotions attatched."

992,2,"Hi, I (f19) was involved in an armed robbery while working in a gas station. It'll be a year since it happened on June 22nd.

I was told by a professional that I have PTSD. I'm honestly struggling to connect with the diagnosis. I've had a history with mental illness, and I've always been open about it and embraced healing as a topic and a journey, but I genuinely don't know how to handle this one. I recognize the things that led to that diagnosis, and I know that my behavior afterwards is an indication of PTSD, but I feel like I'm faking it, and I feel ashamed of it sometimes. A lot of days are okay; I can talk about it and make jokes- other days I get so scared that I feel like I'm gonna die at any moment. Some things scare me that make me feel overdramatic, like sounds similar to gunshots make me so nauseous even though the weapon I had aimed at me was never actually shot- my behavior when I'm out alone can range from normal to borderline paranoid.

I've talked about it so much too. I was fully planning on writing a fully detailed description of everything in this post, but I just feel like I can't or something, but not in a horrible way just in a like my mind is going blank way. The last time I told the full story was a week or two ago, I was giving my experience for a presentation someone was doing for gun violence. Now it's like I want to talk about it but suddenly there's nothing there.

I feel so normal too, I haven't dissociated in ages, haven't had nightmares in a few weeks I think, I've been fully focused on my finals and looking for a summer job since I haven't had one since I quit the gas station, but I feel so stuck and tired and overwhelmed but also completely and overwhelmingly like idk ""fine""? But the fine doesn't feel GOOD. I'm so confused.

Is there anyone that understands what I'm saying? Is this normal? Are there any steps that I can take towards recovery? Is there any advice that I can get for this? I'm just trying to figure this out and I'm lost. Am I just being overdramatic? "
993,2,"It's been 4 years since my abusive relationship ended and I don't get panic attacks or dissociate anymore (thank you therapy). I live my life without feeling scared and that was such a defining emotion in my life for so long. My therapist recently went through the list of goals I set when I first started seeing her and I've achieved every single one. Sometimes I find myself missing it though, both being in the relationship and being a total trainwreck of a person after it ended. It was so horrible and I was an alcoholic and I gained 40lbs and always wanted to kill myself and I was a horrible friend and pushed people away. It was also exciting and exhilarating though. The highs with him were high and the lows were really low. 

Now I've mellowed out, I have several long term friends who I love and who love me back and I take a lot of care to treat them properly. I sleep well at night and I do well at my job and I never think about killing myself anymore. I feel the most normal I ever have and I never ever thought I'd get to this point. I'm extremely grateful to my therapist and I cried when I realized how far I've come.

 The missing that period is a recent development. I know I'd never want to do that again but I find myself reminiscing sometimes and thinking about how exciting it'd be to be back there again. Then I feel ashamed and disgusted with myself. I feel like maybe a part of myself is missing now that I'm not constantly in crisis anymore. I also feel conflicted because I felt like so much of me was taken when he traumatized me and I've been hoping and trying so hard to feel whole again, and now that I'm healing I feel incomplete in a different way. Does anyone else experience this? This is kind of corny but I see a bit of myself this way in Shauna's character from Yellowjackets. My therapist says this is normal and makes sense but I'd like to hear it from people who live with PTSD"
