Well, last weekend I used it and as I was cleaning up I realized this little knobby piece that is part of the valve was missing.  This piece is small relative to the rest of the device but absolutely critical.  I spent all week looking for it.  Searched through my garbage and pulled out my fridge to see if it rolled under there.  Eventually I concluded it must of fallen out the window (I'm on the eight floor) and didn't think that I would ever find it.  I started buying canned beans, even.

This morning I was making oatmeal.  I used the back burner which I don't always use but its perfect for making oatmeal.  The base of the stove is black, same color as this piece.  What should I find in the back corner of my stove?  You guessed it - the little knobby piece.

Feeling so much better now that I've found it.  I wanted to post this message on a community dedicated to relief but when I searched for that mostly dirty stuff comes up."

<3  * I have shared a photo to show the difference in my weight for reference* 

Close to 6 months ago I weighed a total of 228 pounds and wore a 2x shirts/tops, XL pants, size 15-16 jeans, a 2x jacket, & my bra size was  42DDD.  I had a double chin, lots of body rolls on my tummy, sides, and back, my belly lays over my pants, had more stretch marks , and had some fat that moved on the back of my arms (close to my underarm). 
But since being back on this medicine that I‚Äôm supposed to take for my headaches and excess spinal fluid aswell as getting off my antidepressants.. I‚Äôve noticed changes in my eyesight and my now-nonexistent headaches..as well as other changes to my body like my stretch marks disappearing and instead itching more, my double chin isn‚Äôt so large/fat, my belly doesn‚Äôt lay over my pants-depending on the pants, my back fat on my arms has went down and doesn‚Äôt wiggle nearly as much. And then more physical changes I‚Äôve noticed have been that I can wear XL shirts/tops, M/L/Xl pants (depends on how they are made), unknown size now in jeans, L jackets and my bra size now is a 42DD.  
When asked ‚Äúhow did I do this weight loss?‚Äù or ‚Äúhow did I lose all that weight so quickly?‚Äù I actually become stunned because this is not something I set off to do, like this wasn‚Äôt a goal put in place of mine.  The only answer that I can provide people is the following:  Being on medicine that requires a daily routine has put my body in a routine and getting off my antidepressants I feel like has caused me to be clearer minded in ways and that has allowed me to put more awareness in things that I do.. like watching how much I eat in a day, I will binge eat if I‚Äôm not careful. Getting offs the meds I feel like also gave me a sense of in control, and I have used that same type of control to watch what I take in on a daily basis but not overly controlled in that sense but I will make sure to not only snack on candy or sweets.. and not to eat too much of them either. 
Once I took some photos of myself one day and didn‚Äôt want to vomit at the ‚Äúfat‚Äù that I saw all over my chin and face, I felt sort of happy at how I looked- but I have a history of suffering from body dysmorphia, and for the first time of seeing myself and not wanting to puke I began taking more photos of myself. Now, from time to time my friend and I will get dolled up, and take photos via Snapchat only because doing that makes me feel happy, confident, and for once pretty. 
A few days ago I had to go to the hospital and they weighed me. I weighed a total of 185 pounds. I wear XL shirts/tops, L/XL pants depending on how they are made, unknown size in jeans, XL jacket, and my bra size is 42 DD. 

I can actually say that I think I‚Äôm pretty and I can‚Äôt wrap my head around how I got here tbh, but I‚Äôm glad that I‚Äôm wears I‚Äôm at. 


TLDR; I did weigh 228 pounds and was in 2X clothes, bra size was 42DDD, had a double chin, stretch marks, & body rolls. I got put back on medicine for my headaches and excess spinal fluid that can help with weight loss. And I got taken off my antidepressants. Being off meds seem to have made my headaches more clearer-  went to the hospital recently and got weighed. I weigh 185 pounds and am in XL clothes, bra size is 42DD. I used to want to pile when looking at myself, but nowadays when taking photos of myself I feel pretty. Body dysmorphia is something I struggle with and for some reason it‚Äôs mind over matter for me currently when confronting that disorder and my current weight loss. 

I FEEL GREAT :) üëç "

21,0,"I'm a 24f and have been working at a fast food place near my mother's house for three years as of July. Up until recently, I was roughly the third oldest person working there, and now unless our district manager or our closing shift lead is there I'm usually the oldest person on shift by the time the afternoon rolls around. We just hired a new guy a couple of weeks ago who's my age, but the rest of our coworkers are between 17 and 22. About a year in I was offered a shift lead position but I declined as that often means opening or closing and I don't have a reliable ride, at least not at those hours. I can't afford a car on my pay and my ADHD makes me lack the focus required to operate a car. I own a scooter so it's enough to get me around town but not to work because I live and work in different cities about 15-20 minutes apart. The scooter is preowned, formerly by my great-uncle who now is suffering from dementia, whose wife (my great-aunt) begged me to keep it inside city limits for my own safety.

Recently, I began looking for a new job and when one of my coworkers found out (20f) she admitted she'll be sad to see me go because I'm basically the work mom. One of our leads (20f) usually gets the short end of the stick and since getting hired back on after quitting about a little more than a year ago she often doesn't get breaks unless another lead or manager is there to run the shift so I often bring snacks on hand in case that happens, or as she calls it, ""coming in clutch"". I know how it feels to work a long shift on an empty stomach so I usually keep gummy works, snack plates or sodas/juice on hand so that anyone who doesn't get breaks at least has something they can snack on at an opportunity. When two of our leads turned 21 I got them each a bottle of liquor for their birthdays as they were less than a month apart, as well as a little thing of hi-chews and ferrero rochers.

I know my coworkers truly appreciate me, and I don't mind being the work mom. I'm sometimes the mom of my friend group because I'm usually the oldest as I was held back a year so most of my friends are 1-3 years younger than me. I'm also the oldest of six and helping raise my brother (2.5). I love the people I work with but preparing to rent a house with my sister and roommate means I have to move on to a higher income job since I don't think I'm going to college. It'll be sad to leave, but I have most of their contacts and we all live within the same two counties, so we sometimes hang out outside of work."
22,0,"Bear with me, long story short, my dad died when I was two years old (2000). I have no memory of him barring his death. I cant remember his voice, and all the photos we have together I have no memory of any of them.

  
BUT

My mum recently moved out of the family home and found some old vhs tapes in the loft. Without my knowledge she watched them, converted them to dvd and sent them to me, with a note ""enjoy""(Those of you a certain age may see whats coming.) 

I put them on slightly confused as its been years since I've brought a dvd, I turned it on and...instant tears. I'm not an emotional man but the first scene was me and my dad playing together in the garden of my childhood home. I heard his voice for the first time and I saw proof outside of still photos that I once had a dad and I loved him with all I had, as I've heard all my life. I spent the afternoon watching all DVDs that went right up to about a week before he died on Christmas 1999. (He died three days after millennial new year). I was an emotional mess, and for me that takes a lot. I've had them for a week and I literally cant stop watching them over and over again, this was all I ever wanted to hear his voice and see something of me and him together. My mum has always been the best, strongest woman I've ever met and I can never thank her enough for this.

27,0,"I‚Äôm 24F and even though it still seems young I‚Äôve battled substance addiction, depression, and near homelessness because of unfortunate life events, domestic abuse,  and even more unfortunate decision making of my own. For years I didn‚Äôt like the person in the mirror and didn‚Äôt care to make anything better because I didn‚Äôt plan to be here much longer. I didn‚Äôt have the best relationship with anyone like family or friends because I had already planned when to exit my life and wanted to make it easier for everyone else. I always made the shortcut decision/easier option because I didn‚Äôt want to go through anything hard but instead made everything harder in life. I dug myself the deepest pit in life and everything really did seem hopeless for years. 

This is a new account of mine because I would use burner accounts to post how much I was ready to leave but so many redditors, without ever knowing who I could be, believed in the potential I had and shared with me the same troubles and listened, and also helped me hear what I needed to hear.

I have stable housing, I get to enjoy hobbies and connect with people. I‚Äôm happy. :)

30,0,"So bit of back story so this makes sense - almost 3 weeks ago, I was in a nasty car accident. I am also 6 months pregnant. I was maybe 5 minutes from my house, and I came up on a 20mph curve, I was on the outside of the curve. Thats important. I live in a very rural area, so this is a small country road, and people tend to drive it like they're running from the police. 
Upon entering the curve, a truck coming the opposite direction takes the curve at what police now know was between 45-48mph. Not an insane speed, but pretty insane for how sharp this curve is. He took it fast and wide, giving me no time to react. His truck made contact with my front driver side corner of the hood, which sends my vehicle spinning. Car hits ditch, which then sends my vehicle into a side roll. Landed on the driver side. Guy slows for a second and then speeds off, basically leaving me for dead as far as he knows. Thankfully there were several witnesses. Also, thankfully despite the crash totaling my vehicle, I was relatively unharmed. I ended with a few cracked bones, obviously a lot of bruises, but I and the baby were alright. Anyway, I'd posted in another sub about my insane MIL suddenly being concerned for my wellbeing, and happen to include information about the wreck, but it wasn't the main focus of my post. Here's where our feel good story begins. 

Many people commented about how they were glad me and the baby were okay, comments about my MIL, etc.. And on one reply, I'd stated I still had a lingering headache. I don't know why the next reply stuck out to me, but it did. Someone said I should be checked for Post Concussion Syndrome. Normally, any medical advice on the internet is brushed off, but this person's comment just stood out to me. So I went back to the hospital, just for peace of mind. I didnt have the evidence of PCS, but it turns out I had a minor bleed in my brain, resulting in swelling and thus causing the lingering headache. If I hadn't gone back in, I was told I could have ended up in a coma, with severe brain injury, or dead. Thankfully I didnt need surgery, but if left unchecked, I would have. That would have obviously put my life at risk, but also that of my unborn son. It could have meant a way too early emergency delivery, or the loss of my son. I don't even want to think of the rest of the horrific scenarios. I just want to express the fact that my faith in humanity was restored by this person.
Why? Because they took the time out of their day to care about me, a complete stranger. They didnt have to comment that. They could have just read my post and moved on. Instead this person took a moment to say ""hey, I'm worried about you, go get this checked out"". Even though my headache had nothing to do with my post, heck it wasn't even IN the post to begin with. I firmly believe their advice saved not just my life, but the life of my son. It saved my family the grief of losing one or both of us. It saved my other children their mother and brother. Just one simple comment. I am so truly grateful to this person for showing me that care, that I want as much of the world to know the same thing. 
To that person, I know we've spoken via chat and I've probably said it a million times - thank you. Thank you for taking the time to show concern for me, someone you don't know. I hope that your act spreads, because we need more of that in the world. I hope that this puts a smile on the faces of those of you reading this, as big of a smile that it puts on my face. 

To answer ahead of time - the bleed resolved with minor medical intervention, and I do have a followup with a neurologist. The baby was checked over and over during the 24hr monitoring I was placed on, and he is perfectly fine. Although he stayed quite angry at the constant monitoring and has made his displeasure known by thoroughly beating the heck out of my kidneys. "

34,2,"There is a huge, kind of scary looking guy in our neighborhood. He's like 6'9"" and 300 pounds with a FuManchu, tattoos - the whole thing. I'm kind of an introvert, so am not comfortable talking to people, although I have waved at this man on occasion.

*I say all of this to set the stage for our unexpected encounter...*

My wife and I were walking around the neighborhood yesterday evening, which was pleasantly warm and just perfect for a stroll. As we approached this one house we could hear what my wife called ""thunderous laughing.""

As we came up on the house, we saw this huge guy in his fenced front yard on his knees laughing as this brown rocket of a dog is running around in full zoomie mode. She'd stop to grab a stuffed animal as she passed by and throw that around, hop around, run around, make little yips. It was so fun to see.

We stopped at the fence to watch and when the guy, (Luke), saw us he called in his huge voice: ""Come in, come in - this is so great!

We stepped into the yard and the dog, a 6 month old Boxer puppy named Sally was being every bit the comedian that Boxers are known to be. Now she was making her zoomie runs to include us, once throwing her stuffed animal toward us.

Apparently Luke's daughter had driven down from another state to visit and, of course, brought her new puppy, Sally. We had such a nice time and Luke and his family were so welcoming and friendly. They invited us to a family picnic this Saturday. Although that makes introverted me a little anxious, we're looking forward to it.

Well, at home I didn't show it, but I was really upset, so I took myself out to the local coffee shop to get some hot chocolate.  Not a big chocolate fan, but the Coffeehouse' here in town has the best hot cocoa in the world in my opinion.   Anyway, this other lady was at the coffee place, too, and was really upset because she'd had a bad day and customers had been <censoreds> to her.

So, even though I was also having a bad day, I offered to buy her a coffee and we talked.    Apparently it was her first job, she works at Walmart, and she was stressed, and she didn't know if she could keep going there.   I told her the same thing I was told when I started working in a call center.

How people behave toward you is a reflection of them, not of you.   You're not a bad person, and you don't deserve that kind of treatment.  And if customers get abusive, there is no shame in walking away.

Honestly, between the coffee and just talking to someone who's been in the ""trenches"" of customer service as well, I'm 50 now, I've dealt with it WAY too much, heh, I think I helped.  At least she didn't seem as upset, or as stressed, by the time she left the coffee shop.  I didn't tell her I was there to cheer \*myself\* up due to losing my job.

I'm still job hunting, but I see the woman at the WalMart from time to time.  She looks like she's finally relaxing into the job, and we at least wave to each other if she spots me.   I'm glad I could help, at least a little."

It has spawned video games, novels, and even a TV show in the 90s. Each set of game books allows players to assume different supernatural character types. Vampires, mages, werewolves, ghosts, and so on. Most of the World of Darkness is naturally full of evil, sorrow, and misery. But there are some very bright points. In Hunter the Reckoning, you can play monster hunters gifted by supernatural ""messengers"", implied to the beings behind many religious interpretations of angels, spirits, loa, and other divine emissaries. The one I really like and the focus of this post? The Redeemers.

Redeemers follow the virtue of mercy along with the  martyrs and innocent creed hunters. Redeemers don't see all monsters as evil. They recognize many people didn't have a choice in becoming a vampire, ghost, ghoul, changeling, or any other creature that was once human. Redeemers will destroy any completely evil monster beyond hope but will put considerable time and effort into figuring out which monsters can be saved. Most of the time they cannot make monsters human again but they can find ways to redeem them and help them reclaim their humanity in spirit if not body.

The redeemers have many abilities that let them heal others, halt conflict, and reach monsters by drawing out the hidden humanity they have buried inside. Below are some of their abilities.

 

* **Bluster**: A shouted word can abort any type of deliberate attack. It can turn aside any weapon or magical attack against any target and It can only protect against actions that an individual undertakes.
* **Outreach**: The Redeemer appears reasonable and non-threatening to a monster. They must be unarmed and visibly nonaggressive, making some kind of reassuring comment to the subject. To the creature, the approaching person simply seems innocuous or interesting, but not dangerous or tempting prey.
* **Insinuate**: The Redeemer asks a question to the supernatural creature, interacting with it as if it was a person, and it forces the creature to confront mortals in human terms. It usually causes intense feelings of sorrow and loss, as they're confronted by forgotten memories and suppressed compassion.
* **Insight**: By surveying a monster for enough time for signs of humanity, they can deduce information about their past life as a human, what they miss and regret losing. 
* **Respire**: The Redeemer heals a person or hunter. It can heal cuts, slashes, damaged organs and broken bones. To supernaturals, it steals energy. It's dangerous even to intangible foes.
* **Punish**: By touching a monster, the Redeemer can draw the remnants of humanity from a monster to subject it to the terror and pain it'd inflict to a would-be prey. Every creature's experience will be different.
* **Preserve**: Using this edge, a Redeemer can keep someone who has been severely injured from dying as if by will alone. They simply urge their fellows to hang on long enough and focus on them, usually managing to get them to survive long enough to receive medical care.
* **Becalm**: The Redeemer radiates their inner calm and tolerance. It makes it difficult for those around them to act and actions seem to be performed as if subjects were groggy. It also stifles anger, alleviates fear and tension, and makes subject relax somewhat. 
* **Abjure**: Once this edge is activated, the Redeemer seems to represent all that is good, pure and worthy about humanity towards monsters, a reminder of everything they have lost. It can invoke feelings of misery, guilt or fear and most creatures will try to get away as quickly as possible. Monsters who actively seek redemption or feel regret are not driven off, and instead the Redeemer seems like a role model to imitate.

The thing I like the most about redeemers is that they can create another source of sustenance for monsters rather than what the monster normally feeds on. This allows the creature to live among humans without hurting them. And the source they create must be a food that holds personal significance to the monster when they were still human (like a dish prepared by a loved one) which helps the monster keep on the right path while holding on to what is human in them.

Instead of playing a hunter that just goes around killing monsters, playing a redeemer lets you go around helping and healing people while redeeming monsters and bringing back their humanity."

In case it's of interest (and to provide some feel good content) I wanted to share a cute pet adoption story (please remove if not allowed):

Little Pluto was down in the dumps when he first came into our care ‚Ä¶ quite literally. This poor puppy was abandoned in a dumpster at just 8 weeks old. Fortunately, he was found by a San Diego police officer who noticed how weak and lethargic the puppy was and immediately brought him to our San Diego Campus. Unfortunately, Pluto tested positive for parvovirus. But just three weeks later, Pluto had kicked parvo to the curb (thanks to his amazing care at our Pilar & Chuck Bahde Center for Shelter Medicine) and was getting adopted! Oh, and did we mention that Pluto was being adopted by the very police officer who rescued him? Talk about a perfect ending! Watch this video of the happy adoption moment when Pluto met his new family ‚Äî he even wore a special hat for the occasion üêæ

So I called my uncle Carl and ask did he have those old 8mm. His answer was yes and he agreed to send me some of the best.

62,0,"We have a cousin with austism we'll call ""Nate"".  We usually go on outings with Nate to various things to help him get out and socialize. He's pretty high-functioning, but he has very noticeable autism traits, the most prominent of which is his inability/refusal to make eye contact.

We were recently at a convention, and there were cosplayers there.  We happened to stop near one who was wearing ""black sclera"" contacts that cover her entire eye, so that when you look at her eyes you only see black. There must be a hole in the middle she can see out of because she was walking around and looking at us etc.

Anyway, Nate made sustained eye contact with her for the ENTIRE conversation.  It doesn't seem like a big deal, but we have known Nate his entire life and he has NEVER looked someone in the eye for more than a quick glimpse. He looked this cosplayer in the eye the whole time, and he didn't show any of his usual looking down/away when people talk to him.

The cosplayer was super nice to him and asked him if he was having fun etc.

Anyway, just wanted to share and hear some people's thoughts on it.  Other than Nate I don't really have experience with people with autism so I am excited to hear people's thoughts!"

I had an incredible amount of debt from some hospital bills, no job, my credit was horrible and I was on the verge of being kicked out of the house I stayed in. I was only required to stay 3 days in the psych ward but I chose to stay for an extra week and it was the best thing I have ever done. I turned my life around. I got clean, started working again, tried to make amendments to those I hurt and give back what I took (I could never truly redeem myself on that one) I began getting out of the house and surrounding myself with other people in recovery and my debt started to decrease. I met the most beautiful woman, the kindest soul who actually loves me back unconditionally. Today, I am 14 months sober and I just got more great news. MY DEBT HAS BEEN FORGIVEN. 16k worth of hospital bills and other bills in collection have been removed.

66,0,"Tldr: I asked my grandma to help me with something so I could take care of her and she still felt independent.

My grandma was 89 at the time and had been an independent woman for over 25 years since my granddad passed. Slowly she began to get older and naturally her abilities started to decline. She became hard of hearing (deaf in the end), was unable to drive herself, she started getting issues with walking (she was an avid hiker before) and other small stuff started to go due to arthritis in her hands.

At some point she got glaucoma and had to use special eye drops, at this point my dad and my aunts (with good intentions) had started to fuss about her capabilities to care for herself. 

-Yes she needed help with things, but they took almost everything out of her hands including things she was perfectly capable of doing herself.-

She confided in me that eventhough she was old she loved being able to still do things for herself if she was capable and was sad that people were treating her like she was incapable all of a sudden...
She needed to get surgery for her glaucoma and leading up to it my aunts were making plans of who would take care of her after surgery. (whose house she would stay at because she couldnt stay at her own house by herself)
The main issue was the eyedrops she had to take after the surgery and due to the arthritis it was difficult for her. Some time before the surgery we had gotten her a pair of special glasses to help apply eyedrops and she claimed that they worked very well and she didnt need any help.
My aunts asked her to show us how she uses them but she refused to show us, out of pride I think, so that just convinced my aunts that she couldnt be alone.

So...

One evening I went up to her and asked her to show me how the glasses worked because I had issues with getting my own eyedrops in properly and wondered if they could help me.. (total BS, I dont even use eyedrops) and she just LIT up and showed me right away cause she wanted to help me so badly!!

Well the glasses sorta worked for her but not good enough that she could be left to do it herself after surgery.. 
However she had told me how much she wanted to just go home when it was done and how she really wanted to stay independent.
So I lied to my aunts and told them that the glasses worked really well and she really didnt need any help, and I made a deal with them that I would go to her place to look after her the first few days after surgery. (They both live quite far away so it was easier for me)

At the same time I told my grandma that for work I had to go to a different office location for a few days for a project so I would sleep at her house because it was closer.
That way I could look after her and she still felt like she was self sufficient. With the added bonus that she felt so happy that she could help me by hosting me at her house for a couple of days!! (I did arrive a few days early and left a few days after so the dates of my ""work visit"" didnt exactly match with her surgery)

The look on her face when I asked her to help me with the glasses, and when I asked to sleep over was priceless! And the idea that I gave her some of her independence (however small) really makes me happy.

I do think she realised at some point at least that I was playing a trick on her but she was just grateful that I wasnt treating her like a porcelain doll like the rest of my family. And during my stay there I just let her do her own thing and arrange her own stuff, I only stepped in twice when she really couldnt handle it.


So yeah thats my thing haha! Love my grandmaü•∞"
67,0,"We have a cousin with autism, he is pretty high-functioning but he has many noticeable ""autistic"" traits, the most observable of which is his inability/unwillingness to make ""normal"" eye contact when talking to people. We make sure hang out with him from time to time and do various things, like go play kickball, walk around the mall, etc. This time we went to a convention. We were walking around, and he was having a good time and being his normal self. When he approaches people and talks to them, he looks down at the ground or closes his eyes for several seconds.

There were many cosplayers there. One group of cosplayers we ended up having to stand by for a few moments as we waited for a group of people to pass. We ended up saying hi and asking them about their characters etc. I noticed that our cousin (let's call him Nate) was actually looking at one of them directly, which is very rare for him. The only reason I initially noticed was because it was so out of the ordinary for him to actually look at someone's face/eyes. Anyway, she was very kind, and asked him his name, if he was having fun, etc. He made direct, sustained, and ""normal"" eye contact with her for the entire conversation. She was wearing some kind of all-black contacts that cover her entire eyeballs, including the white and colored parts. I assume there is a hole in the middle for her to see through, because she was looking at all of us and moving around etc so she could clearly see. (I did some googling and apparently they are called ""black sclera contacts"".) Anyway, Nate held eye contact with her the whole time, looking her directly in the eyes. I know it probably doesn't seem like a big deal, but for Nate it was extremely unusual for him to actually look someone in the eye.

We didn't want to make a big deal about it to Nate because we didn't want to make him feel self-conscious or overthink it, but we tried to ask him some questions about his conversation with her, and how he felt about it. He said that she was ""really easy to talk to"", so we asked why, and he said he liked talking to her because her eyes were ""soothing"" and made him feel relaxed.

My girlfriend (we are lesbians) is just so sweet and kind. We've only been dating a little under two months but I know I love her. Nothing about our relationship is over the top or super intense. It's quaint, it's pleasant. These are gonna sound like such small, insignificant things, but it is exactly these small acts of kindness that feel like true romance to me. I could list the bigger things I do for her but these are the things that actually made me feel like a good girlfriend the past couple days:

1. She told me that she fucked up the rice that she was making to make rice balls today and that she was bummed out. I told her that having people over and cooking for everyone is hard and that it's the thought that counts and that I was proud of her anyway. She told me that I helped and that she felt better.
2. She was having a bit of a moment where she was feeling proud of herself and I reinforced that and told her how much I like her and told her she was right about herself that she *is* cute and such. She told me that ""that meant a lot for me actually.""
3. Tonight she said to me ""Honestly you've made me so much happier with how my body looks. Like, it's not that I've been worried about it. More so that I've always thought 'oh what if people don't think I'm cute cause I'm fat' or stuff like that, but you find me cute!"" AND SHE'S SO FUCKING RIGHT I DO FIND HER CUTE AND I LOVE HER SO MUCH AND AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. 

It just makes me so happy to hear that I'm making her happy. She's making me so much happier than she knows as well. "

 I also want it to be anonymous, I don't want to know the recipient or the family. I don't want people to owe me anything.

78,0," I'm Alina, and today I stood up for someone who needed it. It was in gym class, and we were all playing a game of dodgeball. I noticed that one of my classmates, Jake, who had a mental disability, was struggling to keep up with the rest of us. Jake wasn't as fast or as coordinated as the other kids, and he was having a hard time avoiding the balls.

At first, I wasn't sure what to do. I didn't want to draw attention to Jake or make him feel embarrassed, but I also didn't want him to feel left out. As the game went on, I saw that some of the other kids were starting to make fun of him. They were calling him names and laughing at him when he got hit by the ball.

That's when I knew I had to do something. I walked over to Jake and asked him if he wanted to be on my team. He looked up at me with a smile, and I could tell he was happy to have someone on his side. I took him by the hand and led him over to our side of the gym.

At first, some of the other kids looked at me like I was crazy. But I didn't care. I knew that Jake deserved to be treated with respect and kindness, just like everyone else. As the game went on, I made sure to include him in our strategy and encourage him when he made a good throw or dodge.

In the end, our team won the game. But what was even more important to me was seeing the smile on Jake's face. He knew that someone was there for him, and that made all the difference. From that day on, I made sure to include Jake in all of our games and activities. I learned that sometimes all it takes is a small act of kindness to make a big impact on someone's life."

Which I never do. I feel as if I have nothing going for me even though I know I have the potential to do whatever I want. I just feel lost when it comes to making decisions. I want to improve myself in all areas of my life. I'm sick of being a bum and all around disgusted with myself. I am currently on methadone, and I've been blind dosing for several months in attempt to stop taking my medication. This leaves me feeling sick sometimes. I have good and bad days.

I'm hoping that maybe doing this vlog will give me the motivation to not give up knowing that all these people are watching and waiting to see my results. From past experience I've come to find out that I need to be forced into helping myself at times. My negative self-talk conquers over my ambitions, and I've done therapy and practice DBT skills. So, any thoughts out there? Would people be interested in this? Body, Mind & spirit transformation vlog. 

(I'm sure my personal interests will come out in the vlog a lot too- for ex. gaming/movies, conspiracy theories, anthropology, hiking to waterfalls, camping, ancient civilizations, minerals, gardening, drawing/painting, playing guitar, everything and anything horror, especially supposed real paranormal instances caught on camera  etc.)"

89,0,"Isnt this something all of us ask ourselves. Its not about being attractive but about being beautiful. I have been asking this to myself for idk how many long long years. We are brought up in a society where being eye pleasing is an achievement and nothing is more attractive than your confidence. But is it so? I have come up with a big line of attractive people in my circle. Some were witty, some were charming, some were eye catching while some where boringgg. There are number of tags we imply on people based on their looks, color, preferences and opinions. Just because he/she wasnt appealing enough for you doesn't mean they aren't beautiful, and those who are always on point with looks are not always happy people to be with. Comparisons, discussions, clothing ,styling, fashion all lead to unnecessary insecurities, anxiety, depression, overthinking, self-consiousness and many more. rom am I looking good today to am I looking stunning today. Babe you dont have to look stunning, you dot have to hold people's attention, you dont have to be everyone's fav. You infact just have to look human. Start with asking nothing but ""Am I looking myself today"". The person I love to be, the person who cares about nothing, the person who has just one reason to live life to fullest and that reason should be YOU. Having great set of people roaming around you wont give you solace. Having everyone talk about you wont give you right attention. Having anything and everything wont give you satisfaction, Its YOU and only YOU who can make yourself happy or sad, strong or miserable, wrong or  right. And when you think everything in you is against you, then find people who can actually give you the best mirror to see yourself. No one is bad , no one is good, its all about who is god anf bad at pretending. In 19 years of life where I might not be a teenager soon all I want to say to everyone and more to myself is you have done a GREAT job at being someone else, now stop, take a break a deep breathe and start with being no one, but the best version of you. Not the good version, just the best. Be that person who won't let you down, might disappoint you, might discourage you, but never let you down. Cause thats how you actually become BEAUTIFUL"

We are a small unit, just my parents and myself and our pets. Always have been. We aren't blessed in anyway besides having each other and I'm so blessed for them! I fight with them sure, we are different people, but I love them so much. I'll miss them when they move on but I prayer, every day, that they go together. And in like 35 more years so I have more time with them.

I want to share this feeling with someone which is why I am posting. I'm so grateful!

I live with two roommates, both a hassle in their own rights, and one of them was in contact with someone with covid. Sadly, it was their mother, so they couldn't spend this holiday with their family either and were worried for her. I hope. But because I hung out with my roommate the same day they had lunch with their mother, right before getting tested, I have locked myself down, away from people outside my home. Meaning, no family for me either. I already worked yesterday and Christmas Eve, so we were just going to do a brunch so I could eat, beforehand, together. Of course, it was cancelled.

But they, mostly my mom on this one who I argue with the most (boomers :P), was so sweet! She called me, upset about it all. She has high anxiety and thinks this will be our last Christmas together, she gets like this. Asked me if she could stop by and just take my picture like she has every holiday. I said yeah but don't get close, from the driveway. She then sends me cute pics of my pets! And my dad too, I guess. I convinced her to get a picture of herself too, she doesn't have confidence in herself. I wonder where I get it.

Anyway, they come by and brought myself and my roommates food from the brunch! Sandwiches, desserts, chips and fruits and some small gifts they wanted us to have to have something to open on Christmas. My Dad also brought my dogs so I could see them in the car! We talked again later because I had to thank them again for it all.

It was a great Christmas and because of those actions, I didn't feel alone or unwanted. And I'm so so so happy that thinking about it yesterday and today has brought me to tears.

And while I have you here, if you are still reading this, can I talk to you guys about their gifts for me? I asked for this and I'm happy they got them even if they don't understand why I wanted it so bad.

I play DnD, so I asked my parents to each find a set of dice they liked a lot and get me them. They aren't going to play but when I do, I can use them and think of my mom and dad. 31 years old and I'm getting excited over a toy but I don't care! They find some they liked and it suits each. My mother has this weird taste, so they have many colors to the dice that ... is interesting lol. And my father got this pearl white set that looking closer is glittery, he has nice taste closer to mine and while plain, that suits him very well.

I very much encourage people to ask for similar gifts!

I would love to know what gifts like that people have received, it would cheer me up more.

Also, please forgive my spelling or grammar errors, I'm dyslexic and don't think I've caught all of my mistakes.

Hope everyone has a good end of this year going into an amazing next year! Love and Joy!!"

I have recently moved houses and that made it hard to keep in contact with the couple of friends I already made here. Anyway, things have been rough, I have been feeling like I'm living an extremely lonely life and with the holidays approaching I have been feeling completely blue. 
Last day tho, we went out for Christmas lunch on the closing day of our firm. Everyone were in a good mood after the food, we were all standing out on the sidewalk, and I was talking to this one female coworker I have known for a few weeks and had a couple of interactions with. She, outta nowhere, told me she was expecting a baby. I was pretty shocked and happy and we both started giggling and smiling like excited fools in the middle of nowhere with the other coworkers looking at us like we were crazy. She said I'm one of the only people she has told this over here apart from her family and people back home. It genuinely made my whole day and probably the rest of my year. I realise there are little miracles everywhere we look and things will eventually get better for me as well.

I (23f) am a travel nurse who recently got the opportunity to work for a hospital in Wisconsin, the pay is good and I liked the hours so I took the job. The only problem is I'm from California and it's becoming winter in Wisconsin and I'm not a huge fan of the snow. Part of the agreement is that the hospital will provide a place to live, so they set me up in an apartment building about a mile away from the hospital. Anyway there are a few people in the hospital who live there and I quickly became friends with them. Anyway I had invited one of the nurses (let's call her Jen)  I work with, over for morning coffee and as we were chatting she glanced out the window and she made an idle comment ""There goes Spook.""  I look out the window and sure enough someone is jogging down the street. Keep in mind it's like 20¬∞ with snow and wind. I ask Jen how she knows the guy and she responds ""we work with him."" And that seemed to be the end of that. The next day I began work and called down to pharmacy because I needed a medication. After ordering it I was told it would be right up. A few minutes later I was on the computer charting and right behind me I hear a deep gravely voice ""I have the PCA for (insert room number)."" Now I'm not usually a scared person but something about the deep voice and the sudden appearance made me jump out of my skin. I turned around and saw the guy for the first time. He was about 6' maybe 6'1"" and looked about 24. He had an imposing figure. He just looked mean. I read his name tag, let's call him Bob. I couldn't see the bottom half of his face because he was wearing a mask (covid) but I could tell he wasn't smiling. I'm not usually a girl to be scared of people but the way he held himself made me shiver a bit. As hes handing me the PCA I glance down and see his hands are covered and I mean covered in scuffs. He looked out of place in a hospital. I glance back up and I can tell he knows I saw his scuffs. I simply sign for the PCA, he gives a single nod and walks away.
   The next few days I see him walking around delivering drugs and see a few nurses talk to him and I only got more un easy. He never said more then the bare minimum of words and always said ma'am or sir. Everyone else seemed like it was normal and if it was anyone else I would have said they were just shy, but he gave me serial killer vibes. Even when one of the nurses told him a joke and Everyone else was laughing he simply shook his head and walked away. No smile, no laugh, nothing. 
   On about my 4th day I see him walking around and he locked eyes with me and pointed at the box he had in his hand. Thinking had a drug for me I racked my brain thinking of the stuff I had ordered. I couldn't think of anything so I just shook my head no. He gave a single nod and walked away. A few minutes later I leave a patients room and see one of my fellow nurses (let's call her Mary) reach into the box pull something out, put it in her pocket, she smile at him and said ""good luck"" and Bob nodded and walked away. Later in the shift Mary pulled out an expensive looking peice of dark chocolate. We started talking about our love of candy and I asked where you would buy something like that. Mary said ""I don't know where he gets it"" I ask where who gets it. She gives me an are you serious look. And says ""Spook. Didn't he offer you some?"" 
""No I never meet the guy"" 
""Really! I'll introduce you to him Thursday (it was Tuesday at that time).""
""OK.""
   Thursday rolls around and I see Bob walk by. He's guarding his left side and looks annoyed. 
   He walked up to Jen and hands her a drug and Jen looks at him concerned. 
""How did it go?"" She asked.
Bob gave a half hearted shrug before giving a thumbs up. Then he held up 3 fingers.
""Good job!""
He gave a single nod and walked away.
Mary (who was sitting next to me) waved him over as he was walking by. 
""Bob this is (my name)"" and then she turned to me and said ""(my name) this is Bob.""
""We've meet"" Bob said. 
""OH well how was last night?""
Bob again gave a thumbs up. Followed swiftly by raising 3 fingers again.
""Knock out"" he said before walking away. 
   The next 15 minutes was spent putting the peices together. Bob was Spook. And he was a cage fighter of some sort. Which made me not like him even more. I'm not a violent person and something about 2 people fighting for the entertainment of others didn't sit well with me.
   That all happened last week.    
   Yesterday it was snowing very hard when I got off work. And as I was waiting for Jen so we could walk back together. It's about 9:00 at night and it was going to be a miserable walk. It was cold and windy and the snow was super wet. Anyway Jen walks out talking with Bob. Jen gives a big smile. 
""Bob offered to drive us home"" and although I didn't like the idea I trusted Jen and it was a preferable option to freezing. So Bob went out walked to the end of the parking lot and started his truck. He then opened up the back door and threw a blanket over something, before he pulled up to the hospital entrance and Jen and I rushed out. Jen got in front with him and I got in the back. I took my time to look at the license plate and remember the number. Anyway I get in the truck and the first thing that hits me is the music he's playing. It's nothing like what I expected. Instead of country, rap or rock he was listening to a soft song in another language. (I later learned it was Italian) anyway I'm in the back and next to me is a huge pile of things covered in a big blanket. I peak under the blanket and there's a ton of toys. Probably like 6 big nerf guns, maybe 12 barbies, a few action figures, a few board games and puzzles. All in all I think it was near $600 worth of toys. I'm freaked out at this point because I think he's a child kidnapper, but I look up and see him looking at me in the mirror. He slightly shakes his head and I quickly put the blanket back. We ride home as Jen talked to him and Bob gives his one or 2 word responses. 
   This is where things get interesting. I walk in to work today and see a table set aside for Toys for Tots, only it was filled to the brim with toys. Yesterday it was almost completely empty. I look and recognize a few of the barbies and a few of the toys from Bob's Truck. 
  The most shocking thing, no one knew who brought the toys. They had there suspicions but there was no concrete evidence it was Bob so they couldn't even thank him. One nurse made a sly comment about the toys to Bob and he just turned a blanket stare at him and said ""If I had that much money I'd pay off college dept."" He just lied so smoothly and denied anything.

I feel horrible for thinking he was a bad guy but I don't know how to approach the subject of the toys and apologize to him. Any advice?"
96,0,"I struggle with body dysmorphia and some days really struggle with how my body looks though I try to be as healthy as I can, I'm not skinny but I'm not massively overweight either I sit about the middle or what some would call chubby buff. being a woman who is tall (5'10 or 178 cm) with broad shoulders and with a chubby buff stature which for my sport at the time was a plus but for general life its hard to be confident I have always received many negative comments about how I look because it wasn't feminine. 

But today me (19f) and my younger sister (15f) was talking and and she randomly told me that her friend (15f)  really looks up to me and wants to achieve a body type like mine. And at first I was confused because why? 
but then the more I thought about it the happier it made me because how I look now I didn't do anything drastic to change it like how i have previously when i had a terrible relationship with food and overworked my body.

When i stopped my sport i simply just existed, let my body be as it wants, developed a more healthy and manageable relationship with food, and someone was inspired by that. It feels good to be able to be someone a young girl can look up to as it's not something I ever had at their age."

‚Ä¢I‚Äôm a pretty skinny guy. I weigh in at around 125 as a senior in HS and I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô9. It used to bother me a lot more than it does now, but it still gets to me from time to time.

‚Ä¢I go to the gym sometimes, I‚Äôm definitely not an everyday ‚Äúgym rat‚Äù kind of person, but I go when I find some free time in my busy life.

‚Ä¢I don‚Äôt consider myself to be a bad looking guy at all, this is not a pity story or anything like that. I‚Äôm very happy with my looks, outside of how skinny I am of course. 

Now for the story.
Yesterday, one of my closest friends asked if I wanted to stay after school and watch the girls volleyball game with him. His sister and girlfriend are both on the team, so it was a bigger deal for him than me. Still, I accepted his offer and went with him. The game was pretty entertaining, and my school‚Äôs team won by a landslide. We were waiting for his girlfriend and sister to finish up changing in the locker room, as all 4 of us were going to get some Chipotle for dinner after the game. A girl on the team who I‚Äôm not very close with but still friendly with walked over while we were waiting. As a gesture of saying hello, she jokingly and very lightly punched me in the chest a few times. She then gave me a funny look and exclaimed, ‚ÄúDamn, have you been working out?‚Äù  For skinny old me, this is the best compliment I have ever gotten and the first time anyone outside of my family made any sort of comment about my weight gaining journey. God, even 24 hours later I can‚Äôt help but smirk when I think about it. Compliments go a really long way, even if it‚Äôs a simple and quick compliment."

We passed and with a meeting with the administrator they said we could do the repair course. 

I told them I was color deficient. They told me about a special contact lens called the X-Crom. It helps people see color. 

So I went to a special doctor and got it. Now I can see all colors. 

Fast forward years later. 

I am driving to work and hear on the radio of this person taking their family as hostage. The problem was he was trained as a electrician but was color deficient and blew up some circuits. After a bit it calmed down.

When I got to work I called up that police department. I asked about that guy and they said ya, so what. I told there is a treatment for color deficiency and it is the X-Chrom contact lens. I even gave them the name of the doctor that invented it.

The men were old friends that hadn't seen each other for a while, so their conversation was about catching up with each other.

He bought a commission from me and paid me way more than I deserved, I literally wanted to cry. I am for sure re-drawing it for him because I was super nervous doing it live, but WOW that was wholesome. I am for sure getting this man an end-of-year gift or like an actual sword idk.

118,0,"This week, my husband was involved in an accident. It was the other guys fault. Thank goodness no one was hurt. Fortunately, the accident was caught on a store camera. The other driver lied about what happened, but the police saw the video. 


Today, the appraiser was so impressed with the condition of my hubby's 18-year-old truck that he is giving him a $10,000 settlement. This money will be used as a down payment on a newer truck. We are both blown away by this, as we both assumed the amount would be much lower. He had been talking about getting a newer vehicle; now it will happen! It makes me feel good because he's a great guy and deserves to be rewarded for the care he took of his little truck."
119,1,"I know some people prefer dogs and others cats. Initially I wanted a dog but I was (still am but it's better) going through depression and needed a companion. I wanted to buy a puppy as I had always wanted MY own dog. After looking online for dogs in my local area I felt it wouldn't be fair to the dog because 1) I spend most of my time inside after my long work days and 2) I live in an apartment. So in the end I decide to get a kitten. After looking online for kittens I came to the realization that I should instead go to my local animal shelter and give one of those poor souls a new home. So I call my local animal shelter and ask if I can come by and see some cats (this was the day after I got a litter box, scratch post and other toys). When I get there they have me sit in a room that reminds me of going to the doctors with your parents as a kid and they go to bring the cat. It was like this little guy was meant to be my fur baby. He looked just like a cat I had as a child I named ""smokes"" (I named him that because he was brown, black, and Grey and I thought of a camp fire when I found him on the street). I instantly fell in love with him and decided then and there he was coming home with me.

The next day I brought him home and let him do his own thing as I've had cats before and knew it takes time for cats to get adjusted to new places and people. Well imagine my surprise when within 24 hours he's falling asleep on my lap on laying next to me when I sleep. At this point I'm already pleased to have a cuddle buddy but he even began to follow me around the house and jump on my lap and almost beg for pets.

2 weeks go by (I got him while my work was temporarily shut down) and I have to go back to work. I feel bad about it but I trust him not to be mischievous as he has already learned how to use his litter box and doesn't jump on tables and counters. After a long day of work I come home and am exhausted and just want to shower and sleep, but what do I hear... the jingling of a bell coming toward me. My little ""Hare Bear"" (he was named Harry Potter at the shelter and you don't change an animals name) running to the door. I crouch down and he jumps onto my bent knees as I proceed to put his head by my ear and hold him and give him back rubs.

He has done this every day for over a year and whenever I have to leave town for more than 4 days (my brother house sits for me) he sprints to the door, slides on the hard wood floor, all while making a sound that I can only describe as a bloodhound puppy trying to howl for the first time. 

I'm certain that this cat will live a long life and help me do the same, and I dread the day his time comes and I won't be able to say ""see you after work"" in the morning after scratching his little fuzzy head.

TLDR: Depressed guy gets a cat who becomes his cuddle buddy and greets him at the door after work everyday."
120,0,I have an eSports class and there isn't much games to play but I chose to play Fortnite and picked duos my teammate was for sure a little kid and we were playing and we won him and his mom were excited and sounded happy and he said I was beautiful and that just made my day
121,1,"I've suffered from ongoing depression since child-hood. And I'm not normally a happy person or very talkative in general. I don't make eye contact when talking to people or hold a good conversation very often. But I went to get a new phone today and the girl that was helping really ""took my breath away"" so to speak. She was beautiful. I found myself easily talking to her about things like anime and other stuff (which there was no one else in the store so we got to chat about other things then phones). We talked for about 10 minuets while my old phone was transferring data to my new phone. And she brought me to the shelves with the different phone cases and the conversation went a little something like this. ""And you're gonna be putting a phone case on this aren't you? I would hate to see it broken"" ""Yeah it would be quite the shame for one of the 7 camera lens' to break, I'm thinking this one right here"" I say as I grab an all black otter box case ""it's basic like me I'm not trying to stand out a whole lot plus I work in a warehouse"" I proceed to show it to her and she grabs one and says ""well what about this one? It sparkles just like your eyes"" and that one sentence that one minute detail about me she noticed. I was actually speechless flooded with emotions I've not felt in years over a simple compliment. I felt happy for once taking to her after that and to that I say thank you. Though you will never read this and I will regret not asking for your number I will never forget your kind words. You cured my depression for that small amount of time and I'll always be in your debt for it."

124,0,"Hey everyone! I had to search to find a subreddit like this because I‚Äôm feeling amazing for the first time in forever. I just got out of a huge depressive episode. I live in Alberta, Canada, it‚Äôs dark and snowy and frigid, my university classes were all moved online (again) for rising covid cases, and I felt really unsatisfied with everything. I was isolated and alone. I haven‚Äôt talked to my friends in awhile, I haven‚Äôt dated in years. I have huge anxiety about going to doctors, but 3 days ago I saw the kindest, most open and nonjudgmental doctor in my life who really took my concerns seriously. I started a new antidepressant and today it hit me with a ‚Äúwow! I feel good‚Äù. 

Like I mentioned, I‚Äôm a university student, but I didn‚Äôt mention I‚Äôm in honours psychology. I have a field placement at a counselling and assessment clinic with an old professor of mine who no longer teaches at my university. Last week I finally summed up the courage to ask about potentially staying on after my placement expires in April. Today, I got offered a job part-time as her psychologist assistant, starting in May and going until at least December! It‚Äôs the start of a dream come true. One day I want to be a psychologist myself, but getting a job like this is more than a lot of people my age and in my position have achieved. I‚Äôm so fortunate and grateful. 

I‚Äôm trying to go slow, I texted an old friend, asking to meet up and she said yes. My relationship with my family is getting better. Most days we barely talk or see each other, but now we‚Äôre having conversations and eating dinner together. I already feel less isolated and more energized through what I‚Äôm doing. 

I really, really apologize if this isn‚Äôt the intention of this subreddit,I just wanted to share the news with someone, anyone! I hope everyone knows there‚Äôs hope to get out of a hard place in life. I know my story really isn‚Äôt that bad. Even though I was lonely and isolated, I had more than a lot of people. I had an education, a family, and a home. Im grateful for it. I hope everyone is feeling happy with life, and if you aren‚Äôt, then I hope something will come to change your perspective soon. Peace!"
125,0,"Today, I bought some crackers. They're these weird little Naan Crisps that say they're Cheddar flavored but really don't taste much like cheese. But they're pretty good, and I think I'd like to try the Sea Salt ones next.

And that last bit is the part that made me stop and think ""Huh... I'm doing pretty well!"" See, a few years ago, I wouldn't have bought these crackers at all. They're like $5 for this small little bag, and you could easily get a lot more snack for $5. Right across the aisle in the grocery store sit the Lay's Family Size chips for way less than this little bag of crackers. And it used to be that I would always take the Family Sized Lay's over the Naan crackers, just for the price point reason alone.

But now, I look at a $5 bag of crackers and don't even think twice about buying them, just cus I wanted to try them. Because now, I can afford to do that. I can just buy things when I want to. I'm steadily improving my quality of life, and man that realization feels good.

So I wanted to share it. And for you folks out there, this your call to look for the little things. Sometimes a $5 bag of crackers is all it takes."
126,0,"I live about an hour outside of the major municipality of the town I live in, so for my dentist's appointment I decided to carpool with my significant other while they go to work. I took the day off today and the back seat of the car is really comfortable so I didn't mind waiting for him at all. 

I was cozy wrapped up in a blanket and working on a report on my computer when a sharp rapping on the window just behind me makes me jump out of my skin. But when I spin around, all I see through the window is an aged hand holding out $20 USD. 

This woman, who was previously obscured by the Blindspot of the car frame, calls to me through the car door saying she cannot stand to see someone down on their luck. I hastily opened the door and gently pushed the bill back toward her and briefly explained that I am just here for the sake of convenience and that someone would need it far more than I would. 

She chuckled herself into a more comfortable conversation demeanor and looked like she was about to burst with emotion (I didn't understand this, but I appreciated it nonetheless). I slipped my mask on and gave her a nice squeezy hug and told her that it's kindness like this that keeps the world turning. 

I think she may have actually started crying then, as she promptly turned away and thanked me. I said as cheerfully as I could muster that she make my day and I hope hers ends up just as well as she make mine. 

Thank you in perpetuity, kind lady; from the blue-haired kid in the silver Honda."
127,0,"I bet that 90% (or more) of feedback that store managers / companies hear are complaints.

When you encounter hard working, diligent, dedicated staff members, let their supervisors and the companies know! And tell staff directly!

Not only does it spread good vibes and cost nothing, their managers will (hopefully!) appreciate them and maybe even reward them with bonuses/raises. If not, hopefully, the staff may properly value their own contributions and look for a better job if they are not recognized for their hard work.

I have gone so far as to send really nice letters and e-mails to companies, singling out the specific instances when I had particularly good experiences. And extra points if you name the staff member(s)!

It's also a great feeling to know that you made even a tiny difference in someone's life."

The store was the only thing left of his dad, so it felt like losing his dad all over again. Some idiots decided to loot the remains of the store and steal all the alcohol they could, which really was only 6 bottles. They posted it on their social media of them stealing and laughing at their haul. My friend decided not to go to the police because insurance will handle it all. Well, although insurance will cover everything, I still decided to stand up for my friend and message these guys. I blasted them on my social media and spammed their inboxes with the go fund me page. I told them the situation with the father passing. One of the looters was sympathetic because his uncle just passed away, apologized, and ended up donating to the go fund me. It wasn‚Äôt nearly the total amount of the alcohol they stole, nor will the alcohol get returned, but it was enough to feel like justice was served."
134,0,"Once upon a time, I was 3 years old, and during a heated fight with my mother- my father told my mother ""Keep the f*cking kid. I would rather never see her again than keep putting up with your bullsh*t."" This left me confused and hurt. I told my mom's boyfriend that I didn't have a daddy anymore and I asked him to be my daddy. He said yes. 

In a perfect world, that would be the end of it and boom I had a new dad and him and my mom would be together and things would be fine. 

Fast forward: I ended up living with my biological father and lost total communication with my mother. I left when her and my step dad got divorced (I was like 10). I was arrested as a teen and always rebellious. I was deemed as a failure and not worth anything. Biological father rejected me and wanted nothing to do with me. I was left feeling like an orphan. My biological father has never met my 3 children and I haven't talked to him in over 8 years. I have tried to communicate with no success. 

When I graduated high school, I started talking to my, now, ex-step father again. My mother went insane and moved away never to be heard from again. 

My step dad told me yesterday that he wants to adopt me. 

Being that I'm almost 26 years old... this is a big win with a lot of closure. That as an adult: my dad would still choose me as his child. He STILL wants the little girl her father dropped and left all those years ago."

147,0,"I‚Äôll go first! I suppose it‚Äôs several memories of the same thing, but I absolutely loved cold mornings on Christmas break with my little brother. Our routine was wake up, head downstairs, eat some cereal, and play Wii games until my grandma came home in the afternoon. I really loved watching him play his favorite Lego games (he let me have a turn sometimes lol, but I still preferred watching him play), and Super Mario Galaxy, too. When my grandma came home, she‚Äôd happily ask what games we had played that day, and we‚Äôd go on to tell her about all the levels that were beaten and unlocked. It was something simple and fun, and it was the best."

We were driving back from an errand, and I would look at each of the little shops and think of all sorts of memories i haven't thought about in a long time, so much so I had forgotten most of them. And this place used to be a place were I was very mentally unhealthy and alot of bad times. But like... my best friend was playing his music and we were singing our hearts out to it. And I was just so happy to be spending time with him since he'll be moving soon. And I couldn't help but think if I hadn't gone through everything I did I wouldn't have met him, my best man. And just the realization I would go through all that pain and sorrow again for him, he is worth it. All of my past was worth it for him dude. And man I just feel good cause I don't regret my past. I'm finally over it. I was able to go through that haunted town and still be happy singing music with my friend. Just a nice self realization I just wanted to share :)"

About a week later I delivered the sign. I also gave him a tin with mints... well used to contain mints. On my way back I got a call. *""YOU BASTARD!!!"" ""What?"" ""I'm in shock here. I wanted to take a mint and I almost pissed myself because there was 100 euro in there."" ""Yes""* I replied. *""You said 100 didn't you?""*

The shop survived the lock-down is now partially open. I just got of the phone with him. We were talking about business partners that did not deliver as agreed. That money back would be in order. He started to laugh. *""What's funny?"" ""I just had a thought. How about I 'cancel' the order for the sign you made. Don't want it anymore. Now I can refund your money.""*"

She says yes, and then the older woman asks if she would like a bed for her doll. She said yes, again. As the older woman is walking out to her car the mother started tearing up and told me that their house burnt down two weeks ago and that they lost everything including all of the kids toys. She also said they had just left trauma therapy before coming to the store. 

Once the older woman walked back in with the doll bed the mother gave her a hug, thanked her, then told her about their house burning down. The mother told her that she has another daughter and that both the girls will enjoy sharing the doll bed. Then the old woman goes, ‚ÄúOh, you have TWO girls? I‚Äôll go get you another one.‚Äù After the mother said she didn‚Äôt have to do that. The woman insisted and brought her another one. I have no idea why this woman had a bunch of handmade doll beds in her car, but is was absolutely at the right place at the right time and made this family‚Äôs day. Meanwhile, both the mother and I are crying while I‚Äôm bagging her groceries."
