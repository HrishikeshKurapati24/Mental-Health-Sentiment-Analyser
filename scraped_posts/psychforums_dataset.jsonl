Although normally applied by a therapist, you can use this as a self help method. It is a rather slow process so you will need patience and the determination to stick with it for weeks or even months. Use desensitisation only on mild phobias Mild or severe phobia? Self help using desensitisation is not suitable for severe phobias because the emotions are likely to be too powerful for self help methods. A severe phobia is best resolved with professional assistance. It is likely that you will know instinctively whether your's is a phobia that will respond to this self help approach. However as a rough guide check where your phobic reaction lies on an intensity scale of 1-10. Imagine that 10 is the highest intensity - virtually being overwhelmed at the thought of the stimulus - and 1 is a mild 'ho-hum' uneasiness. If your response to even thinking about the subject evokes an intensity of 8 or higher you would be well advised to seek professional help rather than attempting to do it by yourself. Below 8 indicates that self help methods are likely to work - with a systematic and persistent approach. 'Complex Phobias' You can use desensitisation on 'complex phobias', such as fear of flying, and on 'social phobias'. However do prepare thoroughly as this will make the difference between success and disappointment.", "hash": "da91ae6235df47e0727db951f31129b78d90bf1646a3f9e454679761549e9ece"}

I too have high BP when at the doctors, but at other times it is normal or close to. I used to get anxious over this and didn't want to go to the doctors for fear that my blood pressure would be high and they would find something wrong with me. It was a vicious cycle, but then I read about \"white coat syndrome.\" White coat syndrome is a condition wherein the individual demonstrates elevated blood pressure in a clinical setting, and not in other settings. This phenomenon occurs due to anxiety and apprehension some people feel during a visit to the clinic. This knowledge has helped me immensely and sometimes now I am so relaxed during a doctor visit that I have \"normal\" BP readings. Hope this helps you like it helped me", "hash": "8c4b843d8e33ed1bdce23d63933960f61598ac05fca1f511a8320009204efe8e"}

I think this allows the person to see that nothing bad happens (ie what they fear) as a result of the exposure and it is deliberately mild to ensure the person can use their brain to rationalise against an immediate avoidant response. This technique seems to work best when exposure can be rigidly controlled (ie no surprises) and the patient is in control with someone providing encouragement and enhancing cognitive reasoning. The reason why it is so difficult to address phobias is because the primitive brain is quite powerful to react instinctively to danger to protect the organism and thus overrides the cognitive process to a certain extent. By starting with a mild form of the phobic object, the patient can better cognitively reason against the instinctive response, but it is still not easy. I have deeply entrenched phobias that aren't amenable to desensitisation in a controlled environment because they are not really subject to control. Despite this, the medical profession refused to acknowledge the impracticality and suggested desensitisation. Of course it didn't work but increased the phobia. It took many years before a psychologist stumbled on some of the causal factors and I was better able to treat myself. Part of the treatment issue is often the rush to diagnose to a known condition, even if it doesn't fit right (the shoehorning approach), through expediency and not spending enough time to really understand what is going on. I think Desensitisation works best for irrational object orientated phobias, but is less amenable to phobias resulting from repeated bad experiences that may continue to recur. I have a fear of needles resulting from a particularly bad experience when a nurse tried to draw blood 13 times for a test and witnessing young colleagues suffering with vaccinations and blood streaming down their arm. It's not helped by pain experienced from any subsequent needle as it reinforces the initial phobic experience. It's the same with going to the dentist or a medical practice: I have entrenched negative experiences that are difficult to ameliorate when they keep getting repeated. IMO, we are acutely sensitive to negative events and avoid those circumstances in future as a defense mechanism that evolved for our survival. Correspondingly, positive experiences carry less weight. That is one of the reasons why desensitisation is so slow, because it takes many positive experiences to start to outweigh a single negative experience. If we do experience another negative experience, it generates a severe setback and may overwhelm any future desensitisation approach: that is why desensitisation must be rigidly controlled so that a negative reinforcement does not occur to derail the process. At least, this is how I view the process.", "hash": "0a1272b72eb0117ded35a5ee542c684f2301a7989b105ad5aafc796321a27b9a"}

{"url": "https://www.psychforums.com:443/generalized-anxiety/topic11746.html", "text": "by Butterfly Faerie » Wed May 17, 2006 4:24 pm SYMPTOMS Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is much more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. It's chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint. Simply the thought of getting through the day provokes anxiety. People with GAD can't seem to shake their concerns, even though they usually realize that their anxiety is more intense than the situation warrants. People with GAD also seem unable to relax. They often have trouble falling or staying asleep. Their worries are accompanied by physical symptoms, especially trembling, twitching, muscle tension, headaches, irritability, sweating, or hot flashes. They may feel lightheaded or out of breath. They may feel nauseated or have to go to the bathroom frequently. Or they might feel as though they have a lump in the throat. Many individuals with GAD startle more easily than other people. They tend to feel tired, have trouble concentrating, and sometimes suffer depression, too. Usually the impairment associated with GAD is mild and people with the disorder don't feel too restricted in social settings or on the job. Unlike many other anxiety disorders, people with GAD don't characteristically avoid certain situations as a result of their disorder. However, if severe, GAD can be very debilitating, making it difficult to carry out even the most ordinary daily activities. GAD comes on gradually and most often hits people in childhood or adolescence, but can begin in adulthood, too. It's more common in women than in men and often occurs in relatives of affected persons. It's diagnosed when someone spends at least 6 months worried excessively about a number of everyday problems. Specific Symptoms of this Disorder: Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance). The person finds it difficult to control the worry. The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children don't need to meet as many criteria). restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge being easily fatigued difficulty concentrating or mind going blank irritability muscle tension sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep) Additionally, the anxiety or worry is not about having a Panic Attack, being embarrassed in public (as in Social Phobia), being contaminated (as in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder), being away from home or close relatives (as in Separation Anxiety Disorder), gaining weight (as in Anorexia Nervosa), having multiple physical complaints (as in Somatization Disorder), or having a serious illness (as in Hypochondriasis), and the anxiety and worry do not occur exclusively during Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism) and does not occur exclusively during a Mood Disorder, a Psychotic Disorder, or a Pervasive Developmental Disorder.

{"url": "https://www.psychforums.com:443/generalized-anxiety/topic11746.html", "text": "by Butterfly Faerie » Wed May 17, 2006 4:25 pm Generalized Anxiety Disorder With generalized anxiety disorder, panic is not the predominant feature. Many of the panic symptoms are present to a lesser degree. Instead of brief moments of intense anxiety, the person feels symptoms throughout most of the day. Although the specific manifestations of anxiety vary for each person, this chronic state of tension can affect 6 major systems of the body. 1. The cardiovascular system, anxiety increases the blood pressure, which causes tachycradia (rapid heartbeat), constriction of the blood vessels in the arms and legs, and dilation of the vessels surrounding the skeletal muscles. These changes produce symptoms of palpatations (an uncomfortable awareness of the heart rate), headaches, and cold fingers. 2. In the gastrointestinal system, anxiety leads to reduce salivary secretions, spasms within the esophagus (the hollow muscular tube leading from the nose and mouth to the stomach), causing spasms, diarrhea and/or constipation, and cramplike pains in the upper stomach. 3. In the respiratory system, anxiety leads to hyperventilation, or over breathing, which lowers the level of carbon dioxide in the blood, the symptoms of \"air hunger\", deep sighs, and pins and needles sensations. 4. In the genitourinary systems, the anxious person can experience the need for frequent urination. Men may have difficulty maintaining an erection during intercourse; women may have difficulty becoming sexually aroused or achieving orgasm. 5. In the musculoskeletal system, the muscles become tense. Involuntary trembling of the body, tension headaches, and other aches and pains may develop. 6. Through the changes in the central nervous system, the anxious person is generally more apprehensive, aroused, and vigilant, feeling \"on edge\", impaitent, or irritable. He/she may complain of poor concentration, insomnia, and fatigue. There is often a fine line between the diagnosis of panic disorder and agoraphobia and that of generalized anxiety disorder. Three features distinguish them. First, the symptoms themselves: if an individual is chronically anxious (he/she weould be with generalized anxiety disorder) and also experience episodes of panic, then panic disorder and agorphobia will be the more likely diagnosis. Second, defferent kinds of fearful thoughts are associated with the 2 problems. In most people with generalized anxiety disorder the worries are about the kinds of interactions they will have with others: \"Will I fail in this work setting?\" \"Are they going to accept me?\" \"I'm afraid he's going to leave me.\" \"What if they discover how little I know?\" \"I'll never perform ujp to their expectations.\" With panic disorder or agoraphobia, the imagined response of others is secondary to the fear of personal catastrophe or loss of control, and the person's internal statements and questions reflect this apprehension: \"What if I faint [become hysterical, have a heart attack, cause a scene], and have people see me?\" The panic-prone person focuses more on her/his ability to be in 100% control of all her/his physical and mental capacities. The anxious person focuses more on her/his ability to cope with the expectations and responses of thos around him/her. POSSIBLE PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS DURING ANXIETY Cardiovascular System Tacycardia (rapid heartbeat) Palpitations (uncomfortable awareness of the heart rate) Headaches Cold Fingers Gastrointestinal System Dry Mouth Difficulty swallowing Butterflies in the stomach Gurgling sounds of gas in the intestines Colon spasms Diarrhea and/or constipation Cramplike pains in the upper stomach Respiratory System Hyperventilation symptoms Genitourinary System Need for frequent urination Difficulty maintaining an erection Difficulty becoming sexually aroused or achieving orgasm (women) Musculoskeletal System Muscles tense Involuntary trembling in the body Tension headaches Other aches and pains Central Nervous System Apprehensive, aroused, and vigilant Feeling \"on edge\", impatient, or irritable Poor concentration Insomnia Fatigue The third difference has to do with the person's response to her/his fears. The anxious person thinks about withdrawing from the situations that increase her/his anxiety, and may procrastinate on performance tasks. The person with panic disorder or agoraphobia, on the other hand, is quick to use avoidance as a way to diminish discomfort. In a matter of days she/he will begin to identify the situations that are associated with the symptoms and determine how she/he can steer clear of them, immediately viewing avoidance as the single best solution to the problem.", "hash": "67cc2f0ee3d8671a3462af6d64bb6920aeec44cf1b04afa2645e4d399aabfa9d"}

It involves fear of embarrassment or humilitation in situations where you are exposed to the scrutiny of others or must perform. This fear is much stronger than the normal anxiety most nonphobic people experience in social or performance situations. Usually it's so strong that it causes you to avoid the situation altogether, although some people with social phobia endure social situations, albeit with considerable anxiety. Their concern is that they will say or do something that will cause others to judge them as being anxious, weak, \"crazy\", or stupid. The most common social phobia is fear of public speaking. It is the most common of all phobias and affects performers, speakers, people whose jobs require them to make presentations, and students who have to speak in front of their class. Other common social phobias include: * Fear of blushing in public. * Fear of being watched at work. * Fear of choking on or spilling food while eating in public. * Fear of using public toilets. * Fear of crowds. * Fear of taking examinations. Sometimes social phobia is less specific and involves a generalized fear of any social or group situation where you feel that you might be watched or evaluated. While social anxieties are common, you would be given a formal diagnosis of social phobia only if your avoidance interferes with work, social activities, or important relationships, and/or it causes you considerable distress. As with agoraphobia, panic attacks can accompany social phobia, although the panic is related more to being embarrassed or humiliated than to being confined or trapped. Also the panic arises only in connection with a specific type of social situation. Treatment for social phobia is often best carried out in a group setting.", "hash": "5aae32486eb89500c6a148dd7af8c4f81f424644869f752525859d051a8a870c"}

A panic attack is a discreet period of intense fear or discomfort in which four (or more) symptoms develop abruptly and reach a peak within 10 minutes. The attacks are unexpected. We who suffer from panic attacks have great concern about having having additional attacks, about the implications of the attack or its consequences (e.g., losing control, having a heart attack, going crazy, dying) Because the physical symptoms of panic attacks are so intense, many people who suffer from the attacks feel that the next step must be death. They often end up in hospital emergency rooms and are usually sent home still wondering what was wrong! We fear that the attack will last indefinitely, that we will never recover. In reality, most panic attacks peak within 10 minutes, and then subside. However, we feel so overwhelmed while in the midst of the attack that the few minutes it lasts seems to be forever. After, we ask this question, \"Will it happen again?\" That thought haunts us. It's a horrible experience. We develop anticipatory anxiety, also known as FEAR of the FEAR. We fear not only the actual panic attack, but also anticipation of it. We think \"What if it happens again?\" The slightest physical symptom can set off waves of anticipation and cause FEAR of the FEAR. Here are some fearful thoughts some people have during a panic attack: • Fainting or collapsing in public • Losing control of their body • Becoming confused • Having a heart attack or other physical illness • Being trapped • Causing a scene • Going crazy • Being unable to breathe • Being unable to get home or to another \"safe place\" Never forget there can be a recovery. Effective treatment can eliminate much of the disorder, but it may be susceptible to occasional temporary relapses when you experience stress.", "hash": "25d6d465b273715109afe493c4d906db84b13f881afc2c96166d618189388476"}

This must be done either by your doctor or by a medical specialist. It is very important to discuss your problem with your doctor. After you have been evaluated throughly, your doctor will be able to tell you if your anxiety attacks are related to anxiety disorder or caused by another problem. Many people who have anxiety attacks don't seek medical care because of embarrassment or fear of taking medications. Anxiety disorder is the most common of all mental health problems and can start up in a number of different ways. If untreated it can lead to Panic attacks. Anxiety attacks come up out of nowhere. If we have a anxiety attack in a certain place we may become afraid to go back to that place where we had the attacks. We start to avoid places where our attacks seem to have happened at. We go through great lengths to hide our symptoms hoping it can't be noticed by others.", "hash": "d63359ef8345169515c0bc1e8b6c58cb94989f193535d75c731013f703295044"}
{"url": "https://www.psychforums.com:443/generalized-anxiety/topic11746.html", "text": "by Butterfly Faerie » Wed May 17, 2006 4:28 pm Agoraphobia The actual fear is of being unable to escape, whether you're locked in a mass of people at a football game or stuck in an elevator or a dentist's chair. Many of us can't travel alone, particularly to new places, and many find it impossible to take public transportation. Agoraphobia is often related to claustrophobia - feeling surrounded often makes us panic. Sometimes it can happen after a prolonged illness where you had to be home or in a hospital, or it may come upon you with no warning at all. It is the most severe form of all neuroses. Although it is the most commonly treated phobia, fewer people suffer from it than from other phobic disorders. Because they fear having a panic attack in a public place, true agoraphobics have great difficulty going outside of their homes. Agoraphobia can range from mild to severe. In extreme situations, the sufferer ends up confined to just one room of their home or even to a \"safe\" chair or their bed. We feel we can't hide the feeling inside of us any more and fear that what we are feeling at that point where we will be noticed by others. We worry, \"What if I run across the room\", that we would cry or do something foolish or embarrassing. We are afraid of the way we feel and where it could take us. The thought of \"Will it happen to me again?\" haunts us. We become afraid of being afraid. It's such a horrible feeling to have and some of us become housebound. We lose our friends, our life, everything. Nothing in our life seems to be going well. But there is good news. Agoraphobia can be treated with professional help.", "hash": "cee8b833544829f6bead52746dc1da63ffcec4ff82700e4e9480fe6ba799f401"}
{"url": "https://www.psychforums.com:443/generalized-anxiety/topic11746.html", "text": "by Butterfly Faerie » Wed May 17, 2006 4:29 pm Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) can be a debilitating disorder with the following two anxiety-related essential features : Obsessions : undesirable, recurrent, disturbing thoughts Compulsions : repetitive or ritualized behaviors People with OCD experience unwanted obsessions, which cause anxiety. Severe anxiety produces feelings of dread, worry, fright, and apprehension (see generalized anxiety disorder GAD). Certain behaviors are performed compulsively in an attempt to lessen this anxiety. Although they realize their obsessions are excessive and their behavior is unreasonable, they feel powerless to control either. In fact, their symptoms can overwhelm them and result in severe impairment and dysfunction, which can begin at an early age. Incidence and Prevalence The National Institute for Mental Health reports that about 3% of people in the United States have OCD. Typical age of onset for boys is 6 to 15, while for women it is often later, between 20 and 30. Risk factors like genetic predisposition and environmental stress contribute to OCD. Also, OCD is more common among people of higher education, IQ, and socioeconomic status. Men and women, however, are affected equally. Though its course is chronic and usually lasts a lifetime, it is treatable with medication, behavioral therapy, and, in extremely rare cases, brain surgery. Risk Factors Risk factors for obsessive-compulsive disorder include the following: Genetics Postpartum periods Environmental stressors Although there is no clear genetic evidence, obsessive-compulsive disorder tends to run in families. A person with OCD has a 25% chance of having a blood relative who has it. Like other mental illnesses, it is more prevalent among identical twins than fraternal. There is a 70% chance that identical twins with share it, and a 50% chance for fraternal twins. Currently, researchers do not understand OCD’s genetic mechanisms, though they suspect multiple genes are involved. Women with OCD may experience a worsening of symptoms during pregnancy and postpartum . A recent study suggests that fluctuating hormones may trigger symptoms during pregnancy. The same study reports OCD in 30% of women observed. The arrival of a baby brings new responsibility, a new set of concerns, and changes in routine. While normal reaction to a newborn may include some anxiety, postpartum OCD features disturbing thoughts and excessive behavior regarding the baby’s well-being. The following obsessions and compulsions are common: Obsession Fear of contaminating the baby Compulsion [ Repeatedly washing the baby Obsession Need for reassurances Compulsion Repetitively calling the physician Obsession Recurrent fear for the baby's safety Compulsion Incessantly checking the baby Obsession Recurrent thoughts of bad mothering Compulsion Incessantly checking the baby Obsession Recurrent thoughts of harming baby Compulsion Avoiding or neglecting the baby Obsession \"Thoughts of disturbed order\" Compulsion Ordering and rearranging baby's crib These feelings and behaviors may occur immediately, but often begin 4 to 6 weeks after giving birth. Treatment is necessary to control symptoms and to ensure care of the baby. Environmental stressors that can worsen OCD symptoms include the following: Abuse Changes in living situation Illness Occupational changes or problems Relationship concerns School-related problems Causes Biological factors involving brain structure and activation are associated with OCD. Abnormalities of the frontal lobes, basal ganglia, and cingulum are common in people with OCD. Basal ganglia are involved in routine behaviors, like grooming, and the frontal lobes in organizing behaviors and in planning. The cingulum consists of fibrous bands that assist in communicating the brain’s behavioral and emotional messages. Support for its role in OCD is the fact that surgical severing of the cingulum has relieved and even cured people with the disorder. The Serotonin Hypothesis An abnormally low level of serotonin is perhaps the most well-established link between the brain and OCD. Serotonin is a chemical neurotransmitter that transmits information from one nerve to another throughout the brain. It is released by one synapse(nerve ending), crosses a gap, and is picked up by another synapse. After a message is sent, enzymes in the brain clean serotonin out of the synapses. Drugs used to treat OCD, known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), increase and sustain serotonin levels and reduce or eliminate symptoms.", "hash": "c662fecf4d31d19814832ff6b4a5f43cc955abfe2d63ec41f6b10387eae746c7"}
{"url": "https://www.psychforums.com:443/generalized-anxiety/topic11746.html", "text": "by Butterfly Faerie » Wed May 17, 2006 4:29 pm There are over 275 types of Specific Phobias that are listed according to some sources. In order to qualify for the diagnosis of a Specific Phobia, the person must have an excessive and unreasonable fear due to the presence or anticipation of a specific object or situation; exposure to the stimulus causes an anxiety response; the sufferer realizes that the fear is excessive or unreasonable; and, the avoidance of or distress due to the stimuli causes impairment in functioning. (Isolated) Phobias These are phobias restricted to highly specific situations such as proximity to particular animals, heights, thunder, darkness, flying, closed spaces, urinating or defecating in public toilets, eating certain foods, dentistry, the sight of blood or injury, and the fear of exposure to specific diseases. Although the triggering situation is discrete, contact with it can evoke panic as in agoraphobia or social phobias. Specific phobias usually arise in childhood or early adult life and can persist for decades if they remain untreated. The seriousness of the resulting handicap depends on how easy it is for the sufferer to avoid the phobic situation. Fear of the phobic situation tends not to fluctuate, in contrast to agoraphobia. Radiation sickness and venereal infections and, more recently, AIDS are common subjects of disease phobias. Diagnostic Guidelines All of the following should be fulfilled for a definite diagnosis: the psychological or autonomic symptoms must be primary manifestations of anxiety, and not secondary to other symptoms such as delusion or obsessional thought; the anxiety must be restricted to the presence of the particular phobic object or situation; and the phobic situation is avoided whenever possible. Includes: acrophobia animal phobias claustrophobia examination phobia simple phobia Differential Diagnosis It is usual for there to be no other psychiatric symptoms, in contrast to agoraphobia and social phobias. Blood-injury phobias differ from others in leading to bradycardia and sometimes syncope, rather than tachycardia. Fears of specific diseases such as cancer, heart disease, or venereal infection should be classified under hypochondriacal disorder, unless they relate to specific situations where the disease might be acquired. If the conviction of disease reaches delusional intensity, the diagnosis should be delusional disorder. Individuals who are convinced that they have an abnormality or disfigurement of a specific bodily (often facial) part, which is not objectively noticed by others (sometimes termed dysmorphophobia), should be classified under hypochondriacal disorder or delusional disorder, depending upon the strength and persistence of their conviction.", "hash": "97fa5486b6593ac017f66bf3029b5873e5f29e3953a29b4b8db9e877edf80e5a"}

Maybe they can help someone. My anxiety manifests in what I call \"episodes\". An episode usually lasts a number of weeks and always has a \"focus\" - a thought or worry that's actually causing the anxiety. This state of \"being anxious\" is so distinct to me and feels so different from any other of my mental states that I can pinpoint the moment an episode begins usually to within a few seconds, and I can pinpoint when it ends to within a few days (the recovery is more gradual than the onset). The most obvious symptom is the obsessive thought, the focus, that just will not leave my head even for one second. Sometimes this thought \"mutates\" over time, almost like a virus evolving to get past your immune system, keeping me feeling anxious even when I thought I'd come to grips with the original problem. I think these methods help me limit the duration of my episodes, and also keep me feeling less anxious during them. 1. The anxiety is unproductive If you're anxious over something that you can do something about, like a deadline or a decision, the best thing to do is to tackle the problem. But otherwise, remember that the anxiety is useless. There is no reason to feel guilty about wanting the anxiety to stop. You're not \"running\" from something. 2. You are not running, you are putting it away temporarily It may well be that there are some decisions that need to be made about whatever you're anxious about, or some genuine thinking that you need to do. But now is not the time! You need to put the fire out in your kitchen before you starting trying to redecorate it! Trying to engage with this thought in your current state will be a net negative in the extreme, for every 1% of genuine progress you make on the issue you will suffer 99% setbacks in your overall productivity and well being. You are simply putting this thought away until a time where you can think about it without it triggering panic - that will be the correct time to deal with it. 2. It's not your job to stop being anxious The immediate problem you have is this thought bouncing around in your head constantly. You cannot stop thinking about something by sheer force of will (quick! don't think of a blue elephant). It has been on your mind a lot lately, and so it will continue to be on your mind a lot for a little while, because that is how the mind works. You have to treat this like having a cold. When you have a sore throat, you don't think to yourself that you have to find a way to make the pain stop right now. You just say wow, this sucks, and get on with it. Your job is not to stop feeling anxious. Every minute that passes that you still feel anxious is not a failure. Each time the anxious thought pops into your head again even though you promised you'd stop thinking about it is not a failure. 3. Your job is to continue to be productive and live your life Just like when you have a cold, all you can ask of yourself is that you continue to be productive in whatever sense is meaningful to you. You are not trying to \"make it stop\", you are trying to respond to it as healthily as possible. 4. Ease off the gas, but don't take your foot off the accelerator You are allowed to drop certain responsibilities to make your life easier! Just try to do so in a somewhat disciplined and controlled way. If you go to the gym, continue going - but maybe drop your least favorite exercise, or cut your routine down to a \"maintenance\" routine. If you normally avoid snacks, let yourself pick up a chocolate bar on the way home from work every day. Drop some of your less urgent chores. 5. Soothing, not distraction Try to distinguish between things that merely distract you and things that soothe you. Distraction keeps your brain occupied but ends up making you feel worse. Soothing makes you feel genuinely better, if only a little. The two main things that are soothing for me are taking a walk in daylight, and talking to someone who loves me (about anything, not necessarily the anxiety, although it helps if they at least know you're feeling anxious). Repetitive video games, say, are only distracting (to me). One sign that something is actually soothing is that you may find that, while doing it, although your thoughts circle back to your anxiety, they are sometimes tinged with a little more hope and positivity than usual. 6. Just stop thinking about it When you notice that you're thinking about it, don't feel guilty, don't feel like you failed, but do stop thinking about it. Switch to something else. Of course, it will still be in the back of your mind as you try to do this. That's fine. Just focus on something else. 7. But sometimes, thinking about it is okay Sometimes, your brain finds an angle on the anxiety that it may genuinely be useful to let it pursue for a little while. A good sign that this is the case is if (1) it's genuinely a new angle that you hadn't considered before, and (2) it makes you feel better, not worse. Often I find I stumble upon these new thoughts while walking. If it feels okay to you, let yourself pursue the new line of thought until you've exhausted it or it's starting to degrade into negative thoughts again. 7. Don't hate your anxiety Hedgehogs are anxious too, and it's served them well. Evolution creates anxious individuals for a reason, you just need to learn how to harness it productively.", "hash": "b5677ef8fbbf44a4ff0b913f7a08ccb9dbb7d23394a54a7b8e7f5a469cdbeb9b"}

I tried various anxiety medications, but none provided relief. My psychiatrist suggested trying an antipsychotic (Zyprexa), which finally gave me 100% relief from anxiety. I continued taking Zyprexa for 4 years, but it also caused emotional numbness. After 4 years, I couldn't tolerate the emotional numbness anymore, so I decided to stop the medication. With the help of my psychiatrist, I tapered off it slowly. It has been 3 months since I completely stopped the medication, but my anxiety hasn't returned, and the emotional numbness persists. It feels as if I'm still taking the medication. Does this mean that Zyprexa caused permanent changes to my brain? Can I ever overcome this emotional numbness?

All the best and hope you're doing well. This seems to be the general advice for anxiety-type problems, and it's expressed quite nicely here (I sometimes find the advice patronising or even insulting). In reality, things are a bit more complicated. I used to get a lot of anxiety before going out with friends. \"Don't avoid going out with them, keep going out and the anxiety will go away!\" would be the usual type of advice. However, it turns out that it was a toxic group of friends! Sometimes taking another kind of action - cutting the \"friends\" out of my life in this case - is the right thing to do. In other cases it may be appropriate to take small steps and not rush things too much and get overwhelmed, if possible.", "hash": "4154372795177a1a3fb9f0a38450c6286cdf2131f0733613601d7b11e1e97b67"}

You're right that sometimes it's more nuanced than that and for everyone it's different what will work. So thank you for sharing that. I also feel bad for implying that not reinforcing the pattern is the ONLY thing to do. I didn't mean it like that, just that it was the right choice to make in that situation. There are lots of things that can help; therapy, meditation, living a healthy lifestyle, medication, etc. Also, like floatingtree stated, sometimes changing something in your life or environment is the key. Maybe there's something else in your life that's causing all this anxiety that you need to address? Maybe changing your environment can help? There are a lot of options for improving your life that can affect you in more ways than you realize, and go deeper than you realize. For me, there were times when I changed something in my life and felt a weight lift afterwards that I didn't realize was there, or had told myself I didn't care about at the time -but after realized how much it actually weighed on me.

Allow me to elaborate... Throughout school I always felt like the ugly duckling and was told as much. I did get boyfriends after I dyed my strawberry blonde hair brown and started wearing makeup. When I got to the point where it was time to start working I felt so much anxiety about being around people, because I felt I was being judged on my looks. It caused me a lot of stress and suicide attempts. I wish I could explain the stress, but I can't. When people see stress, they just think \"oh, stress\". But it's way more intense than that, to the point where I drop things, break things (because of clumsiness), make proper eye contact, get uncontrollable shaking. I always hated it because people would say, that other people have it worse because it's so \"shallow\" and \"superficial\" to obsess over beauty standards, and so I felt crazy and rejected by most people I told. \"You're overreacting\" \"You're too sensitive\" \"omg, you're so stupid... I think I felt a little better once I started comparing myself to other celebrities when I was like 12 or 13. Like when Nicole Kidman got with Keith Urban. He was my celebrity crush, and she was an actress who I really liked and I felt I resembled (not as beautiful, but similar characteristics). I always said my crush throughout school looked just like him, and when they got together, I felt relieved like somehow \"my kind\" wasn't completely hopeless lol Of course a lot has changed since then, life and trauma ya know? But I remember how exciting that was for me as well as probably them. Even though I never got with my crush (an later it went away), I was so happy (weird I know). Not ashamed to admit I hated being what people call \"ginger\" lol It seems stupid to most, but it's more than that. My hair was more strawberry blonde than red, but it had more to do with my skin being \"pasty\" and \"sickly\"...and I had bad teeth (maybe genetics or the fact that my depression caused me to let myself go sometimes). I was always very envious when other girls could tan and cover up all their \"problems\" (stretch marks, under eye bags, etc). I hate aging because for me, it happens so fast compared to other people because due to my skin tone the signs of it are very obvious when it happens and no tan to cover it up. Nothing wrong with aging, but premature aging (feels like you lost half your life and confidence in your youth). Not to mention I'm very sensitive, so when my mother took me to the dentist when I was 17, and the dentist told me I had 8 cavities, I had a meltdown and thought I was losing all my teeth and refused to go back and pretty much gave up on them. It was nice the dentist told me the truth, but also made it to where I \"abandoned all hope\" lol After that there was no dental care for adults, at least not the amount for what it would cost to properly fix them that I could still afford. I was however able to get a student loan a couple years later for classes at an online for-profit university ($20,000 for like 6 classes) that there was no way I would be able to graduate from because I was a jr high drop out, but everyone said we needed to go to college and get a better job....so. I have dentures now so it doesn't matter anyways. Just wanted to share because I hoped someone would see so they could understand how maybe not just I feel, but other people like me possibly younger are going through. What's it's like, ya know? This is not to make anyone going through the same things, feel worse about themselves, but I keep hoping if I spam enough, maybe someone will care lol BTW \"ginger\" women are very beautiful when they are taken care of, and their health considered just like other people's, and hopefully other people who feel that way who aren't \"ginger\" lol I just want people to see from my point of view about how self esteem correlates to paranoia and stress...anxiety issues. -- Wed Sep 07, 2022 8:20 pm -- So is this GAD or is this body dysmorphia or what? I'm diagnosed GAD and Bipolar. But most of my anxiety really stems from not feeling attractive or feeling ugly or inferior. Like \"why bother\" if the world is the way it is? How do you get over this kind of anxiety? Because I really don't feel there's a doctor on earth that could fix it lol At least not with some weird vaccine or microchip that controls my thoughts like a robot. -- Wed Sep 07, 2022 8:21 pm -- I also have severe anxiety about intelligence and other things, so it's not just looks...It's everything lol", "hash": "db42153cc7624b68201b3bea594d11ac6e7fbc3bb68532b8a7fe8a7b3556c6de"}

Part of the reason I didn't get them for so long is because I had hoped that I couldn've gotten my teeth fixed without them, but the cost was like $16,000 or more (way out of minimum wage pay) and veneers and implants like the celebrities get are like $2000+ a tooth.

I can't speak to other people's experiences of taking antidepressants but in my experience, they made me feel the depression less extremely. So I felt like lows were less low. This made it harder for me to identify my emotions generally because it seemed like everything was a bit more \"muted\". For me personally, this made it harder to do my therapy because I couldn't work out as easily what I was feeling because emotions seemed a bit less extreme. Eventually after 7 years I came off of them. What has spurred your question? Are you considering taking antidepressants? In a way, I am not defined by my dissociation. In a way, I am.

My way of fixing things wasn't working, so I entered detox and rehab to 'break the chains' and learn new coping skills. It was intensive therapy at first and trying different meds to find one that worked the best. I was inpatient for 60 days, so I was off the streets and in a controlled, safe setting. It would be irresponsible for me to give a yes or no answer to this question as we are all different and react to different meds, stimuli and therapies differently. Some don't react favorably to chemicals and they may try alternatives like ECT with success. I asked my doctor about hypnotism and acupuncture, but those are questions outside of the medical realm and she was not qualified to give an answer. I respected that. I began on Buspar and Imipramine about 30 years ago. I am on Sertraline (Zoloft) now. Attending therapy while undergoing medication is very important. You can't just take a pill and hope for a better place. Monitoring moods and adjusting meds is part of the therapist/doctor job. I was asked if I felt any desire to self-harm or harm others at every session. I didn't, but I think they have to ask that if it is listed as a possible side-effect of the med. There are so many different meds nowadays, the suffering must have been horrible in the old days without them. You would just be locked away in some (in)sanatorium somewhere and the family would try to forget about you. I didn't notice a change in myself as much as those around me did. It was heartening that they saw and heard an improvement, where I really didn't feel much different. The Zoloft keeps the incessant self-chatter inside my head to a minimum. This helps me to focus and concentrate on what I need to do. I still write myself lists on priorities and keep it with me. I cross them off as they get done and transfer some to a new list as the paper wears out. Before, I was all over the map and clueless on what I had to do next. It takes time, but it should get better. Dreams may be intense at first, but I was told to think of it as my brain getting better. I didn't remember or care about dreams much before. It was as if I didn't even have dreams. Best of luck to you. We do NOT delete posts Read the forum rules before posting here.

Those that have this problem probably have other issues going on as well. Like I said, we are all different. Depression and anxiety can't be cured, but we can hope to manage it. I was assured that BuSpar and imipramine had been around since the 1950's and I was on a mild dose. If I wanted to take more than prescribed or attempt an overdose, it would likely be unsuccessful. The chemical takes a while to build up in the system and takes a while to leave. There is little danger of the 'instant gratification' that makes some drugs very addictive. You have to realize that about 11% of the U.S. population is taking antidepressants and a very small fraction have any noteworthy problems with it. I had dry mouth as a side-effect. The statistics are on Google. Many of the meds used to treat depression are also used to treat anxiety. It is almost if one is the flip-side of the other. Due to liability, doctors must ask this. Lawyers would love to go after entities with money. It is prudent to ask as well, I would feel awful if someone snapped while under my care. The doctor has to recognize a problem and hopefully prevent it for the sake of the profession, the pharmaceutical industry, the patient and the family.

Lucky me. A few years ago, it was pointed out to me that I sigh a lot. Some people take that as me being angry, annoyed or bored. I've had to tell some people, \"I'm not mad, I'm just breathing.\" It actually became a running joke for a while. I'm not sure if I do this due to anxiety or because of GERD/acid reflux. I find sometimes that I tend to hold my breath while awake. I don't know why I do that either. I suspect that the sighing is me actually taking a breath again. Does anyone else do this? I ask because my father is angry with me for doing this. I cannot control it. It's so normal and automatic to me. I suspect GERD may play a part, along with anxiety but I'm not sure. I guess I want to know if my father has a right to be mad about me doing this? It offends him. I'm an adult and live with my parents. He only notices it when he enters the same room as I'm in. I suspect I was probably holding my breath while focused on whatever I was doing, then he enters the room and takes my attention away from what I was doing and this leads to me taking a breath - which appears to him as me sighing in frustration. I'm just breathing. From what I've learned over the years, I'm unusual. Most people have not encountered someone like me before. I recognize that I'm very odd. I've found that many people take my normal behaviors the wrong way. They think I'm mad when I'm not. Or they think I'm upset/sad when I'm not.

If I wanted to do things I’ve missed out on I would be laughed at as someone trying to be young. I hate the others my age think that we are old they might want to feel old for most of their life but I don’t just cause your not a kid doesn’t mean your old. I hate reading about how in your 30s supposed to age real fast like really I doubt you just she quickly. I’m tired of it now I have to think about all my anxiety and about my age it feels horrible to think my dreams are gone cause I’m 30 something. I want to get in shape but I guess it’s not possible since I’m now elderly according to society and my muscle are all weakening and all this crap.

I hope it makes sense and can be of help) I think that being 35 is not old at all! And there's nothing wrong with aging. I agree with you a lot, society is just obsessed with youth, especially with women (maybe because it's convenient to make them insecure and sell them products?). I think that considering teenage/twenties to be the best years is kind of overrated and any years can be the best years. Maybe one could be the happiest ever or follow their dreams at 70! Why should the fun stop at a certain age? 30s is young. There's still so many things that can be done! And surely one doesn't become old so fast after turning 30. I think that if you have the possibility you should definitely do the things that you missed out on, you deserve it! If people may laugh thinking that you're \"trying to be young\" they're probably stopping themselves from living too because they've been convinced they're too old for certain things, or they should just learn to mind their business (because they're just plain mean and wrong!). If you're not hurting anyone, what's the problem? Making people feel like after their 20s life is already over is truly horrible. Also being an adult should not mean being always serious and only being allowed to do certain things and that it's too late to pursue what you wish. It's so unfair. There's so many hurtful, untrue and unnecessary beliefs that get pushed on people Your dreams are not gone, you can also have as many more new dreams as you want and deserve to follow them. I think that if you start to \"get in shape now\" your muscles can only get stronger B) I wish you all the fun in the world, and that you can do everything you want!

I'm not new here but I had to make a new account since I forgot what my previous one was called. I've posted my story on *mod edit* and have not received much response so I thought I'd give this site a try again. This is kind of a long story so here goes nothing!: Suffering from my anxieties (long txt) I've suffered with anxiety all my life but a lot of changes have happened over the years- it's gotten worse. I currently take Zoloft for the anxiety and depression and it hasn't been helping. I've worked at a grocery store for 6 years part-time and quit back in January because I didn't want to deal with people anymore and also wanted to help my family take care of my mother who is bed-ridden and cannot take care of herself. I live with my Older Brother (36) and Younger Brother (20) and my household life also hasn't been the greatest. It's been terrible and mentally damaging. My mother puts a lot pressure on me (I'm always home and I'm practically an unpaid caregiver) and my OB is working two jobs so he's hardly home. OB is emotionally/mentally abusive towards YB and I (even since we were little). He's also always been a narcissist. Recently he told us that he wants YB and I to save money to move out on our own and he has \"confidence\" that we can be independent also because he wants to have a family with his fiancé already before he gets any older. Sure, I was okay with it but then there are a lot of factors that started screwing me up. I got a really good paying job at a WFH company and I mostly do inbound calls. One day I started to get this crazy anxiety (panic?) attack before getting on the phone and from then on I've started to do absenteeism, asking to clock out early, giving my team leader and their assistants a hard time (they've tried to console me and have told me that they have anxiety too- that they understand) and it was at this point they realized something and the TL said \"I'm going to be transparent with you- you want a position that doesn't require being on the phones, right?\" I agreed. \"I understand that you tell us you feel bad for wasting our time, because you're not and we have all the time we need. But in this case you are wasting your own time. In order to help YOU we need you to be here on the phones\". I started calling the Employee Assistance Program and spoke with a local counselor and it didn't go well. I've called the Crisis Hotline and at least the guy on the phone understood me! So believe me when I type this- I've tried anything and everything. Losing hours just made things worse for YB and I financially and it's putting a lot of stress on him because we're both supposed to be saving money to move out of this hellhole, pay car insurance, and a personal loan he took out for me to buy a car. (How are we gonna move out without some sort of transportation, yknow?) My anxiety has affected me so bad and warped my way of thinking that YB didn't know what to do with me anymore and his GF convinced me to see a psychiatrist and I have been prescribed anxiety medications but I feel I need more time to recover because I haven't been normal anymore. I am being rushed and shoved to be responsible and to suck it up. Nobody understands that I'm going through so many mental hurdles it's difficult to control!! YB was so upset with me because I asked for a leave of absence so I wouldn't lose the job. I have spoken with my job about moving to a different position BUT I need to be with the company for 6 months to 1 year with GOOD attendance so that just kinda made me lose hope in everything. I wanted to find a different job but no other job is gonna have patience for me like my current one does. Everyone is telling me it's a bad idea to leave the job because it's an easy job and I don't have to deal with people face-to-face and it's my first full-time job. Then YB's GF tells me that if I'm sure I wanna go back because what if I start the cycle again. I'm thinking should I stay or should I seek a different job??? What choices do I have anymore and why can't I just disappear, lol. I feel like a total failure and honestly I just want to get my $#%^ together already but my brain is keeping me from seeing the positives. I feel trapped. My mind cannot stay in the present, it's just thinking ahead into the future like \"what if someone treats you bad on the phones, what if you end up homeless, what if it happens again if you return to work what if what if\" and I'm tired of it!! tl;dr anxiety attacks have been keeping me from working and it's affecting my younger brother and i financially Last edited by Snaga on Thu May 19, 2022 1:59 am, edited 1 time in total.

That comes with major anxiety. I am terrified of emotionally-hurting, disappointing, bothering, or even angering the people I love. If I make a mistake, no matter how kind or gently someone tells me their feelings are bothered...my heart races, my mind tangles, and my stomach hurts, and sometimes I faint. This morning, I was trying to help someone I was worried about, but I was stupid, and ended up really bothering him. They assured me it was all right, just to not do it again and not to exaggerate. I didn't show him I was upset other than profound apologies, but I'm sure he knew. I don't want to show it either. It would make it all about me, instead about him. It should've been just about him as he was the one hurt by my actions! Still, how I wish I didn't try to help at all, because now my body/mind just feels like it should hide away forever. I don't like to do that to my friends or family. Sometimes I wish I could tell them how I feel, but that would make it impossible to be in any sort of ship with me. My friend certainly knows it though...he has to walk on eggshells with me, which I hate! I tell him not to, and try my best not to get upset when he's being so, so reasonable in his direction. That's just one person, but he has a whole world of his own, and I don't want to badly affect that.

I just found this website and thought it might be good to get my feelings out. I was not sure where to put this post since it fits under several different topics so I put it here. Anyways, the title. School is stressing me out way more than usual. Like, to an \"unreasonable\" degree. Given, it's not just school stressing me out, but that's usually what I tell other people because I don't want to get down into the nitty-gritty. For example, if I have a bunch of homework one night I'll get a big panic attack or suicidal thoughts and usually break down in my closet so not to be in front of anyone. I'm in 10th grade, btw. This sort of stuff has been going on for more than a year (ever since COVID started) and it's still not better. In fact, I would say things are getting worse. I now have delusions too, like how my thoughts might be controlled by some outside force or that nothing is real. I sleep way longer than I used to, but often my sleep is interrupted by nightmares. I thought things would get better, because about a year ago I also started seeing a therapist, then taking anti-depressants. My dosage has been increased three times and I still don't feel better. I also take an as-needed anxiety medication that I barely use because it makes me feel even more exhausted. I would tell my counselor about all this but I feel that her advice isn't really helpful and I have trouble talking about sensitive things. My throat tightens and I can't speak. I have had several \"bouts\" of suicidal thoughts in the past, and self harmed occasionally as well. Although, I'm not sure if I should contact the text line because I am suicidal, just not sure if I actually will follow through, but it wouldn't take a lot of convincing either way. If you have read this far, thank you, and please give me some advice if you have any.", "hash": "d8c2d824f3bc8fc6ffc95fc5a21f2698b3f19727e634591eb49c6c588f81ccd1"}

I'm a pretty old fart- and from my perspective, there's been a lot of 'the sky is falling' pushed at young people these days. They tried to do the same with my generation- none of those bad things came to pass. The point being is that I think for a lot of people, 2020 has just pushed us over the edge. So much bad has happened, I find myself on an maintenance dose SSRI for anxiety, and all it does is take the edge off- for which I'm thankful, but it is what it is. I mean, it's not hard to work myself up, if I go out of my way to do it. I can sense that I don't care as much anymore about my fears, and that's a good start, anyway. This post could fit several places, but I think for the time being we leave it in GAD. But I sense some OCD style obsessions and behaviours, particularly the suicidal ideation. I have OCD as well as general anxiety- both undiagnosed but I've been this way only over five decades so I'm pretty sure I know what I got- and between my own life experience, and the stories in the OCD forum, suicidal ideation is common as dirt for people with severe anxiety spikes. I've learned to mostly disregard mine- I have no real desire to die, merely to find 'a way out'. And death is no solution. You can't do backsies if you don't like Dead. And, being an old fart, I can tell you that Life is way too short already, without ending it prematurely. Not saying it never happens, but if severe anxiety often ended in suicide, we'd get a whole lot more turnover in OCD... thankfully, that doesn't happen. If I thought this was a serious desire to end your own life, we'd be talking about this in Cutting & Self Harm. But for now, let's not. I've also self-harmed as a result of overwhelming anxiety- a little as a teen/young adult, which I put down to general angst- it's hard to see it from where you are, but even at the best of times, pre-2020, teenagers are angsty . That's not meant to trivialise it- I was very, very angsty as a teen/young adult- it's just how it is. Rites of passage. Growing up is hard. What I'm getting at is it's really hard to see things from a more balanced perspective at that age. Everything is like, so incredibly overwhelming sometimes. And it feels like well that's just the end of the world, when it's really not. And again, 2020 is just one straw too many, I think. I think this past year and a half has been hardest on young people. Actually however, most of my self-harm has been done in my fourth and fifth decades of life. I'm not sure if that's so much of an OCD trait as something else- self-harm throws self-testing and self-administered test results into a bit of a quandary, I think- the usual paradigm seems to be that self-harmers are Borderline to one extent or another. That's a discussion for another thread, however. If your antidepressants aren't seemingly having any effect, might you be able to broach the idea of changing them? Are you still seeing the therapist? If not, can you? Sometimes pills just can't do it all on their own. If you seriously consider suicide, you should definitely reach out to a hotline, or just show up at ER and tell them you're feeling suicidal. I'm hoping this is more the anxiety talking- but if you're getting strong urges, then talk to someone! You have nothing to lose, and your life to gain. I'm old, and still too young to die. You don't wanna do that to yourself, you have your whole life stretched out in front of you. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts.

That anxiety escalates when I'm sandwiched between two vehicles, or we are in a left-turn lane, and I'm sitting on the right side of the car. I can remedy the second situation by sitting on the left side of the vehicle behind the driver. That way, I'm next to the center medium, putting a bit of distance between me and other cars. I'm in a no-win situation if we are in the left turn lane and there is no center medium. I take 0.25 MG Clonazepam four times a day and 10 MG Propranolol twice a day, sometimes three times if needed. I've also been taking Lorazepam as needed. Dosage varies between 0.5 to 2 MG, depending on the severity of the situation. If I'm in heavy traffic, I will take 2 MG of Lorazepam, 10 MG Propranolol, and 125 MG of Simethicone (OTC anti-gas). I live in an area where good psychiatric care has been hard to find. Therefore I had to go to the county psychiatric facility (which does not prescribe controlled medications such as Clonazepam and Lorazepam) for my other psychiatric prescriptions and get my Clonazepam and Lorazepam from my primary care doctor. The powers that be have been cracking down on general practice doctors who prescribe both Clonazepam and Lorazepam. I had to find a psychiatrist who would prescribe controlled medications. In addition, I've experienced a particularly rough spell since around May or June in which I needed to eat into my reserves. Found a new doctor who I first saw on the ninth of this month. She gave me 10 MG Escitalopram once a day and will either reduce or eliminate the Lorazepam. For the road trip to see her this coming Thursday, she told me to take 1 MG of Clonazepam instead of the 2 MG of Lorazepam. The Escitalopram, which I will have been for two weeks, should already be doing its job. I know I have established a lot to get to the problem, but here it is. I keep my ear to the ground to know what will happen. However, what was once theoretical is happening as I speak. We have inflation that is being downplayed (in other words, it's worse than what the powers that be are revealing) and a supply chain problem.

Severe anxiety because of it? by 59Ballons » Mon Jul 07, 2014 11:28 pm For some reason, 4 months ago, I started thinking about life's existence. Like why we are here, ect. I would continue to deep think, and then that caused really strong Depersonalization and Derealization. Then, every day I would wake up and start thinking about that weird feeling, and I got into this cycle where I felt weird so much that I felt strange *being alive*. I started feeling super-conscious and super-aware of my own existence, and I started asking myself these weird questions like am I really a human? Is life all a game? And then, I became a Solipsist! ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism ) I became this for a week, and I had to pull myself out of this. I continued to think about these weird questions, and I got into a loop of: Feel weird, ask questions, freak out, feel upset because I am questioning life itself, feel weird, repeat. I feel like I have two lives... One life is when I'm distracted from these feelings and I feel normal, and the second life filled with anxiety and self-awareness. I feel dread when I think ahead, and it's almost like I hate being alive! But that's crazy! I feel trapped in my own body! But all of this goes away 100% when I'm distracted. It's insane because I feel like I have to be distracted from my own thoughts in order to live. Sometimes I am able to let these thoughts be... But that only lasts a day or two. No matter how much I tell myself that these are just thoughts, I can't STAND feeling afraid of being alive. I can't relax because I know that I have these problems to be worried about.

Over the past 12-24 months, I've developed a speech impediment whereby I spit while talking. Almost without fail, everyone I speak to starts wiping their face while I talk. Its incredibly embarrassing and I feel horrible. It makes me think twice before speaking up in a meeting and its really affecting my job and professional relationships. It happens whenever I speak to someone who is closer than 2-3 meters from me. If they are 3+ metres away I feel more confident and I speak more normally. This also happens with my close friends. The only people who I don't spit on while talking are my absolute closest family members (wife, daughter, mum, brother). Everyone else cops it. I've done the typical google searches and people say to slow down your speech etc. However, I've tried everything from speaking slowly and speaking quickly, loudly and softly. Nothing works. This has started happening at a point in my life where I actually know what I'm talking about at work. I've got a good 12 years experience in the industry. However, this impediment is really holding me back. It seems to be a vicious cycle of spitting while I talk, so I talk softer and appear less confident. Feeling less confident makes me struggle to speak properly. Does anyone have any thoughts or advice?", "hash": "8e5c1528ec6c3f5c9af3159def157ff056c1d7078c337c1b45ff2393826a578e"}

It started one year ago and I have no idea why, it is slowly getting worse and worse. I have read every voice projection/improvement book I can find, have talked at papers and mirrors from close range to work on softening hard syllabus that may be spitting, and have cut out all sorts of things from my diet in hope of improvement.

How do you treat the anxiety when it's the physiological response that brings the anxiety on? It's a feedback loop. The only time it doesn't occur is when I'm drunk or emotionally distracted (such as being super mad or upset) - but even that doesn't hold it at bay too long, because as soon as I realise that it hasn't happened, it happens.

I went to the doctor, and she prescribed me some medication to help bring my anxiety levels down. The first one didn’t work, but the second one is helping. She then referred me to a cognitive behavioural therapist, and it’s been incredible. She has helped me understand that a past relationship I didn’t want to be in anymore. caused me physical pain during intimacy. This pain kicked off my body to reject him (via stomach cramps, and as it may happen, increased saliva. So close proximity = painful = saliva. Very slowly over the past years, if I ever felt threatened, self conscious, not good enough etc, it would trigger this feeling of danger, and my body’s learned response was to spit (as well as go into fight flight). While I’m in no danger of people being too close, the result is the same. So, the plan. Cognitive behavioural therapy helps me break that learned response. When I first “get too close” to someone, I immediately distract myself mentally in whatever capacity I can (count backwards from 100, count all the money in my wallet etc) to start re-wiring my brain, and teaching it that too close = normal. I hope everyone has already found their own solutions, but if not, give this a go. Find a therapist who is holistic and looks at all angles of anxiety rather than just this one symptom.

I'm no qualified mental health professional, but I realized that this (personally intense social anxiety) is a manifestation of obsessive compulsive thoughts. The intrusive thought that we are obsessing over (involuntarily of course) is that we're going to spit whenever we talk, compelling us to do whatever we can to prevent it from actually happening. Naturally. But then it *feels like it does anyway, feeding into these eventually obsessive fears and creating endless thought loops. For an ex. if you focus on each breath u take, does it make it easier or harder to breathe? For me, it makes it harder. Recently, I saw a speech therapist who said my speech was perfect, even better when I enunciated my words. I truly thought so too, surprisingly, but couldn't figure out why I struggled so much talking to literally anyone else. She said to me that the real problem wasn't my speech or even hypersalivation; it is instead a mental and emotional battle. I was basically in the wrong kinda therapy. Instead of enjoying my teen years, this overwhelming fear took over my life. Avoiding conversations as much as I can, whether it be classmates, family members, teachers, friends - everyone! This crippling anxiety ruined my self esteem, making me isolate so badly that I missed out on so many potentially great relationships and life experiences. Even work and money, given the humiliation.

Over the past few years since my last reply, my psychologist and I also dig deeper and came to a similar conclusion that you did. It was a thought that triggered an anxiety response. We’ve spent some time getting to the bottom of my feelings of low self worth, how they started through childhood (I had a great childhood, and my parents never meant any intentional harm, but not being behaviourists didn’t know how to meet my needs and so I learnt to cope with their inconsistent emotional availability in whatever ways I could at the time). For those still with this battle, look up generational trauma and start working through it (working through Schemas with my psychologist was a crucial first step to understanding feelings of abandonment which possibly led to low self worth which possibly led to social anxiety). There is absolutely a way through this. We tend to hone all of our intention to the one symptom of anxiety (spitting) and the thought directly before it (“oh no I’m going to spit because they’re standing too close to me) and miss the much broader picture that it’s potentially life long coping mechanisms that have been unnoticed and untreated for most of our lives which thus worsened to symptoms we do finally take notice of.

So, You fear getting into relationships, you've also mentioned that you've been seeing a psychiatrist for anxiety. Have you ever tried to question yourself about what it is about relationships that you fear. if you really like the person you are in a relationship with, why does time become such a matter of concern for you? you can try journaling your thoughts and ask yourself the questions that haunt you when you are with a person. what is a commitment to you and do you think every person you are with is asking for a commitment? You broke a girl's heart 10 years back and I think you are still not able to come to terms with the fact that you broke her heart. So once sit with your therapist and try to reflect on why that happened and are you still repenting that? do you fear that you will do the same with the next important person you meet in your life?", "hash": "0004e60e96fa391d4de2b78b4446b2f4499b038bb3633bef5843002b419c7e3b"}

It also feels so insignificant compared to other OCD worries that I even feel a bit silly to say it out loud. I have always loved following England at football. Some of my best memories are watching them in tournaments, and the trials and tribulations that came with it. Something odd occurred in 2010 where I think I subconsciously checked how excited I was when England scored. I didn’t think anything of it, until we got through to the latter stages of the tournament. We were paired with our biggest rivals Germany. What would normally come with excitement and anticipation came with some sense of anxiety about not feeling that way about it. The following years watching England, for some reason when England came to nearly scoring, I would feel slightly anxious about how I will react, which would make me not enjoy the moment. I would check others response and feel a bit jealous how they reacted. Roll on to 2018 world cup. I think for the first time in that period of time, I over thought it less, and enjoyed the tournament more. I got the feels back big time. However, for one of the games I was ill and couldn’t go out to watch it. When I watched it at home I felt like I was missing out, so when England scored I celebrated, but it felt a bit hollow. I was better for the semi-final and went out to watch it. When England scored first, I had that slight anxiety feeling, which made me not enjoy how I would normally. We eventually lost that game, and where I would normally be gutted, I didn’t really feel anything. Roll on to this tournament and it feels rife. Every time England look like they’re going to score, I feel a bit anxious, which makes me not be how I would normally be at a game. It makes me feel sad that I am not enjoying the moment how I should be. This has been off the back of a bit of a relapse in some other OCD related issues. I just want to relax and enjoy the football and not have this weird anxiety about checking how I should be feeling when celebrating. Against I am feeling jealous of seeing how others are reacting. It feels so irrational, but I am struggling to break out the habit. Obvs having OCD means I am questioning and doubting whether I even really like watching England now. However, I know this not to be real. I understand in the grand scheme of things this feels very inconsequential compared to other themes, however because this means so much to me, it really affects me. Anyone relate to this? I have read somewhere about a type of OCD where you check your emotional response to events, and this can affect how you feel about things.", "hash": "c64a91fee2bf79cf75caf9163e520ddb1579ad9de20ea1e102a40ad32f06ff11"}

The thing about having anxiety and that is we're never bored! There's a lot going on in our heads all at once. It's a busy place, our mind. But as you said, you can't comprehend what's going on in the present. How can you enjoy one thing when you have to choose all the time? Life's full of distractions, but you can fight them with small steps. Stop the thoughts going on in your mind and your electric gadgets for a few seconds. Try it, it's hard, I know. But just do it once. Thoughts of past anger, the scary future, the awful news on the internet now, turn it off for a sec and just notice the moment now where you are sitting or standing.

Work... drove me here to PF, anxiety in a roundabout way (I was self-harming over something work-related, and found PF on a search engine about self-harm). For me, my last place of work I often found my body in fight-or-flight mode, as I walked down the long entranceway to start a shift. Intense, crippling, and unrelenting. So I definitely empathize. And, well, sometimes, co workers sure did add to it. A LOT. I've worked with careless partners, I've worked with lazy partners, I've worked with partners hopped up on alcohol and drug cocktails. When you're afraid to take a break, because you literally don't know what absolute insane, you're going to get us FIRED $#%^ you're going to come back to, well... oh yes, I know exactly how it feels to have work sap the life from you, one rapid heartbeat, at a time. I've come home and drank; or self-harmed; or just rode around before going home so I can scream my throat raw. Or just come home, sit in the car, and think of all the nice ways I could off myself. Meh. Some nights I'd just dissociate to the point of I'm just watching as the body does what was expected of it. Once my 'others' began to emerge as distinct personalities (Sam was the first) it was.. both scary, because I'd never been aware of another fronting before, and a blessing, because once enough cooperation had been reached, Samantha took over driving to and from work, and I was just along for the ride- my anxiety then, most of the time, anyway, could turn on when I walked into work, and turn off, when I walked out, and stayed at work, and came home with us, a lot less.

There are some similarities between brain washing and behavioral health therapy, in my opinion. The idea a lot of the time is to get you, or whomever is in therapy, to change the way they think. For example, if you are like me and have harsh negative thoughts about yourself and want to change the way you treat yourself, if that makes sense. Also, noticing the things around you is a common way to ground yourself during an anxiety attack, taking you out of the attack and back into the world by way of taking note of your surroundings. Licking the lips could be an unconscious response to your recounts of sexual experiences, as this, along with such things as biting the lip are consistent with body language present when thinking about sexual things. Granted I think your therapist should probably be aware of those behaviors and how they make you feel, but they are sometimes unconscious behaviors. And I do think it's rude of him to check the time constantly and yawn when you speak, but you never really know what is driving a person and their actions. Perhaps he is anxious about an upcoming event or didn't have time to grab his morning coffee. Does this happen often during your sessions? I have anxiety as well and I know it is very easy to look into stuff like this. I am not in your shoes and will not tell you that you are wrong, but things are not always as they seem, especially with anxiety. If you feel that you are being brainwashed, perhaps look into seeing a different therapist.", "hash": "7a316fee012f21de7ee758101f6c9c3ff7dcff85a0f2f7584a3b3b6a3daf131a"}

It would wake me up in the middle of the night in panic attacks, give me this feeling of intense sheer terror, give me nightmares, and it sounds absolutely absurd when I think about it. It's triggered by the feeling or sight of something being too light, small, or thin, or intense size differences, such as (TW if you experience this) being pulled through the eye of a needle. (TW over) I've never found out what it was. I've only met two people, my father and my friend, who experience this same thing. For all of us, it's given us nightmares and panic attacks, it's a terrible feeling. Does anyone know what causes this? What could be the root of this? I bring this up now as I'm wondering if, and I could be totally wrong in this, it could be connected to trauma somehow. Or, it could be something completely different.

I wish i could tell you exactly how to reduce your anxiety but there are soo many ways to reduce it. not every solution works for everyone. For me (sometimes) depending on the situation I'm in I simply practice breathing exercises where i inhale through the mouth hold my breath for as long as I can without passing out then slowly exhale. That however does not work in every situation. Another thing I like to do is work out. I find that deep exercise lets out all the negative energy and gives me a renewed positive energy. Again please give these a try maybe one of these things will work for you. Good luck!", "hash": "a395cd485f3457e7a09c4e36816d26f6e0fe8e9ed4984dc273f44f3126d4ab23"}

But the problem is that there's a speech barrier that I face while talking to people I don't talk to on a regular basis and new people in general. I fumble alot and its like I just forget English or any other language that I'm speaking at that time . I wouldn't say I'm the fluent in all the languages i speak. But I'm a decent speaker . I just talk really really poorly while talking to new people or acquaintances. Which is something i need to tackle because it comes in thw way of my career . As someone who is studying marketing making calls to unknown people is going to be life . While I was interning at a firm in the marketing department I had to make a lot of calls and I tried everything possible way to avoid it . I mailed and texted and kept delaying . And a simple call took a lot of practice and breathing for me to do . Campus placements start soon and I'm afraid I'm going to mess my interviews and Group discussions because of this.

I told myself that I didn't care anymore, just so the feelings of vulnerability wouldn't get to me. It was a stupid defense, but was all that I had at the time. Apathy didn't help me, it wasn't who I was and I don't think that it ever worked to my advantage to think in this way. I did get mental health treatment after I quit alcohol. The doctor put me on an antidepressant that was also an anti-anxiety medication. Alcohol no longer quenched the panic. It had stopped working for me. The meds did stabilize me so I could listen, decide and act (mostly) appropriately, instead of always reacting to everything by first instinct. It did take awhile to work on my brain chemistry. There was no instant relief. I had to change both my perceptions and behaviors. I had to retrain myself and choose a fresh identity from bits and scraps of the old Wally. I tried to hold on to the good bits. Fear of losing irreplaceable things is still a very real fear, but I have to trust the Creator and Her plan for me while I am here. I tell myself that if Plan A doesn't work, try a Plan B. You can't totally be prepared for every contingency, but it helps if you have a seamless compromise or back-up Plan in mind. In the stress of today's world, having a 'fight or flight mode' really isn't such a bad thing. It just shouldn't consume us or have us in a constant state of war. Breathe deeply. Trust the system.

I often have horrible panic attacks, where I feel like I'm in the electric chair, and my body completely seizes up. Electric chair is the beast way to explain it, because of the amount of pain flooding through me, during this time! It feel like that, or as if there is fire, and razor blades flowing through my bloodstream, along with a billion volts of electricity. My whole body goes completely stiff, eyes roll into my head, hands into claws, and I'm stuck, for a long time. Much like a person, after they've been hit with a taser. I'll be stuck like this for up to 30 mins, at times. My consiousnous does fade, for the most part, but I'm still about 10%. I can recall some things, sometimes. For example, I can remember one occurrence where my boyfriend was patting my face with a damp cloth ( because I sweat so much), or I can remember hearing people around me freaking out and wondering if I'm having a seizure. My body is usuall really dead tired, and in a lot of pain, after that, for a while. It takes a lot to bounce back, from those episodes. They start as panic attacks, and turn into what feels like a seizure, although I probably don't actually know what a seizure feels like, but it's the best description I can come up with. They last anywhere from a few to 30 minutes. It depends on how stressed and stimulated I am, or the severity of the preceeding panic attack. However I occasionally have mild ones, that will come out of nowhere, with no panic or warning, first. Does anyone else have this, or know what causes these episodes?", "hash": "252d9da04783557a12930e324c3b97767e62285f3b7253f5a85bcbf0161996dd"}

I have severe anxiety at times, as well as OCD, and I have experienced many symptoms that will plague me for a while, then go away. I've been dizzy, palpitations, muscle twitches, disassociation, tight muscles in this spot or that, etc etc. Never have I done what you describe, but I've found anxiety can be very clever in coming up with something new in the way of physical symptoms. So for me, anything is possible- it just sounds so extreme, that I wanted to make sure you'd had it looked into. And again, like the post I maneuvered into being seen in BPD and DID, some of what you described in this thread, has a disassociative feel to it.

Growing up, a lot of people find things about themselves they might not like, or seems strange to them, like a certain fetish. Having an interest in things like that is natural as you get older, and I will say most teens with access to the internet will find things like this and sometimes even keep them. It happens. (Though viewing it underage is illegal it still commonly happens) I think it was a good idea to delete ones that were underage. Since you're 18 (correct me if I'm wrong),that could count as a crime of some form. Since you were younger before then, having attraction to other people around your age is also, of course, a normal thing. Honestly underage people should not be posting things like that in the first place, but your attraction to it wasn't sick or creepy. Just beware from now on of the ages and everything of things like that. Since this isn't a direct attraction to minors specifically, but rather the act itself, you probably shouldn't worry at all.

In the interest of time, here's an itemized list detailing in chronological order my history of issues. [*]I began experiencing symptoms of OCD at a very young age - one incident involved me having an intrusive thought about breaking something expensive of my mother's that she treasured. I didn't want to and it caused me a lot of distress wondering why the thought crossed me mind. I was eventually convinced - with a little help - that it must be the chatter of demonic persuasion. [*]When I was thirteen, my dad had a heart attack in front of me at Six Flags and was in a coma for a week. Two years later, I began having severe panic attacks (the kind where I thought I'd been poisoned or was dying - I didn't know what panic attacks were). They've all bun subsided, at least the ones with that level of severity. [*]Recently, reflecting on my life, I've come to the conclusion that I've been manipulative and self-serving on a lot of occasions. When one incident or another comes into my mind, my stomach sinks like a stone. I feel I've treated people in some pretty heinous ways as a means to and end. A lot of the time - not all - I was unaware that the thing I did was inappropriate. [*]I'm twenty six now. I have no job and hardly ever have had - two weeks was the longest position I've held. My education was arrested in the fifth grade because I \"performed poorly.\" I was supposed to be home schooled but that never materialized. I've never kissed anyone. Well, I've never kissed anyone and not ###$ up enough to leave myself unembarrassed. I have trouble talking to people of my own age. Trouble maintaining friendships. Don't know the first thing about flirting. I'm gay so that makes it a bit more unclear how I'm suppose to interact. Oh, yeah, and all this has led me to self-medicate (weed... alcohol... Y'all know the drill). I've tried to spare as few details as possible. Based on what I've told you here, did anything stand out to you as, \"oh, it's probably this?\" I can't seek counseling at this time and I'm not using this as a substitute. I just want to get a little closer to finding some answers. Any help along that journey would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much for reading my message. I look forward to hearing from you all.", "hash": "324ec17c81c1043590fb3ee47a49162e12708fd5d7bf9b66add5962c9c71ca80"}

It sounds to me like your anxiety is connected to the traumatic event/s you described with your previous employer. It’s great that you have already introspected and found part of the problem. In your conscious mind, you understand that he was a poor people manager. You said that he expected things from you without proper explanation, and when you did the correct thing of asking for clarification; he yelled at you and made you feel useless and inferior. This reflects on his poor management skills, and not in any way on your ability or worth. The next step will be to convince your subconscious brain of this, i.e., to genuinely recover your self-esteem. *mod edit* is an interesting article I found on the way we talk to ourselves in our minds, and the impact this has on our self-esteem. Take note of the conversations you have with yourself before a social gathering. Are they positive or negative? Are you reinforcing these anxious thoughts by criticizing yourself even further? If so, make it a habit to speak only kindness and love to yourself (even if you sometimes feel you don’t deserve it). When a negative thought enters your mind, combat it with something like: I am confident, smart and worthy. Only good will come from today’s interactions. As I embrace socializing, I will learn and grow every single day. In time, your brain will start to give you these messages and healthy thoughts automatically. I hope this helps and all the best with your journey! Last edited by Snaga on Wed Dec 05, 2018 10:26 pm, edited 1 time in total.

Then—this is going to sound like I’m loony—it feels like what I can only describe as an “other” takes possession of my body and responds to the situation in whatever way necessary to return the emotional intensity into equilibrium. For example, I feel this electricity when I am in a group and someone starts talking and everyone else ignores the person. Then, even if I don’t want to, I respond to the person being ignored. Another example, recently, my friend was road raging on a group of construction workers to their faces. I started smiling at them and waving even though I knew it’d make us look weird. After we drove off my friend said “you’re too nice you just made me look insane!” And I didn’t want to do that! But the electrical intensity of her outrage was so intense for me I had to diffuse it somehow. What the heck is this? Am I insane? When I google about this all I keep finding are web MD articles about social anxiety zaps. This is not the same. It isn’t a zap, the intense electrical feeling flows throughout my entire body.", "hash": "2e826ed934a57aee22a98927eee1a8e015cb8a4084996b721e3543905cefceca"}

Blood pressure, circulation and nervous system issues, chemical/endocrine deficiencies or imbalances can show up as physical symptoms under stress. My breathing changes when I am headed into panic or distress. I used to hyperventilate without being aware of it. Then my arms, legs and lips would begin to tingle, vibrate and fall asleep. It felt like I was having a heart attack, which made the panic avalanche. After this was pointed out to me by a doctor during an attack, I learned to keep tabs on my breathing. Deep, slow breaths and distraction usually brought me back to normal. It is good to stay in touch with your body if it is trying to tell you something. I would start with a visit to your personal physician. Describe what is happening. They may want to start with a blood test. They may refer you to a specialist for further diagnosis.

Something has been weighing heavily on my mind over the last few days, and it's triggered my anxiety. This is based off of something I recently read. I have a fairly high IQ, and I know it's ridiculous, but it's a worry nonetheless. Maybe someone here can help. My concern is that our consciousness dies in our sleep and is replaced by a copy. At first, I thought that couldn't be the case due to dreams and brain waves that are recorded during sleep studies. But then I read that's not enough evidence for consciousness to continue while we sleep. They said that dreams could just be memories with the illusion of consciousness when we awaken. So on to my question. Are brainwaves and dreams proof that our consciousness doesn't die during sleep? Help is much appreciated. Thank you.", "hash": "ec27b7909e5ce7d46756a1b1004efd8f8955382f4a5a938f53c5d0e1574da18b"}

I was in treatment for anxiety attacks some time ago. Many anti-depressant medications will also help stabilize anxiety, so anxiety and depression are treated together in many cases. It was bad enough where an anxiety attack could slip into panic. I used to medicate it with alcohol, but that caused another slew of problems. One thing I have trained myself to monitor, is my breathing. If my chest tightens up and I feel like I'm suffocating, I can easily hyperventilate. My arms, legs and lips tingle and it can feel like a heart attack. This can make the runaway panic even worse. Deep, slow breaths and a distraction usually help me get back to normal. If you haven't already, I would go for a complete physical exam to rule out any chemical or endocrine imbalances. If all look OK, ask your physician for a referral to a counselor or therapist to find help and relief from this. Best of luck to you. We do NOT delete posts Read the forum rules before posting here.

I'm nearly in tears so here goes. I have been on and off with Benzos, Xanax, Valium, and Klonopin. I have always been so nervous that I would take them nearly every day, sometimes more than I'm suppose to and would often gain a tolerance. Recently, I was placed back on Klonopin after discussing with my doctor my feelings about my Xanax no longer working... I felt as though after an hour passed by I would start feeling sick and anxious. I thought maybe I had developed a high tolerance and was going through withdrawal... So I was back on Klonopin. I haven't been taking it for about a week, and started up again 3 days ago. I know that Klonopin is longer lasting, so withdrawals wouldn't begin right away, however, after about an hour I would feel anxious and break out into a sweat. I started to increase the dose until I was calm, and still an hour later I would feel those horrible feelings... Is it possible that I am feeling klonopin withdrawal so soon? I have never went any higher than what I was taking... I really don't know what's going on with me and I'm so miserable. Maybe its something else? Please, if anyone has any advice I'm all ears... Also, I was wondering, I'm prescribed Seroquel. I have been off it for a few days (it makes me hungry) could that be causing these sick feelings? If I start taking it again would they subside and would I be able to take Seroquel and not rely so much on the Klonopin? I’m also prescribed Adderall, a very low dose. 10mg but I break it in half for 5mg. I noticed when it wears off I don’t feel well and when I take the klonopin it doesn’t help. When I use to take Xanax it would relax me more. Would my doctor put me back on Xanax if I asked him before if I could go on Klonopin, because the Xanax tolerance went up? Maybe it went down? I don’t know how it works Thank you so much for allowing me to share my feelings and ask my questions. I would appreciate any feedback.", "hash": "07cfe80b809554ae242b18232cad20428079cf7defc4b58eea244566b501a7c2"}

I did some research, some reading and answered a few online questionnaires, and had some discussions with my family doctor and with a local psychiatrist. Based on those discussions and on my reading and personal research, everything points to me having ADD or Inattentive type ADHD (I don't have much of the H symptoms): I have difficulties staying engaged in work discussions and meetings, keeping track of tasks at work, as well as paperwork and bills at home, I am very forgetful, I get distracted very easily, always start grandiose projects and plans but never seem to finish them, and I am very disorganized at home, my car and at my work desk. At work (I'm a developer), I'm often capable of figuring high level conceptual problems and discussing complex abstract solutions, but I do poorly and get into frequent trouble because I am slow and sloppy, and frequently get blocked on small details and simple mistakes. Many of these symptoms I remember struggling with since my late teens, but they have gotten much worse in the last couple of years (I'm 40). Several people have told that for some people medication really helps. In fact some described it to me as \"It's like having your glasses off, and then putting them on: Everything becomes very clear and obvious.\" The psychiatrist I was seeing didn't want to put me on medication before I had a formal psychological test. The psychologist who tested me said that I definitely don't have on ADD, based on my results. He tested me for math skills, memory and vocabulary - basically he was saying my IQ was too high for someone with ADD. But instead that I likely have General Anxiety Disorder or Major Depression Disorder (He mentioned the word 'Anhedonia'). The thing is, I don't usually feel sad, or suicidal or anything like that - although I do feel down from time to time, I feel it is mostly driven by my failures at work and my constant underachievement more than anything else. He insisted that my test results were not consistent with someone with ADD, and that moreover ADD improves with age, whereas in my case my symptoms seem to be getting worse. He also mentioned that GAD and MDD can have cognitive and functional consequences similar to what I have, and that most likely I will need CBT, not medication, to address my problems. Am at loss. My problems at work have always been there (since my days in school) and they are now getting to the point where they are endangering my job. Every single second hand and first hand description of ADD I've had describes my own life perfectly, and I thought I had finally arrived at the root cause of my perpetual underachievement. I thought all I had to do was seek treatment and I would be able to get it. Yet the psychologist disagrees and now it seems like I am headed for several more months of therapy and discussions with psychiatrists before I know what to do. What can I do? Is the psychologist right? Does high IQ and math ability contradict an ADD diagnosis? If so, why do I identify so squarely with the symptoms of ADD? What can I do? I am getting desperate", "hash": "3758016f19c96e85b20494ad82eff14d5b537bc92054a070d784a9bbc593e586"}

I am getting desperate High IQ and math ability do NOT contradict an ADD diagnosis. They can help a person compensate for the difficulties presented by ADD, which probably explains how you got this far without medication. And the kind of discouragement you feel, because you know you aren't achieving as well as you could without the \"static\" caused by ADD, is also common. (That's another analogy I've heard: with medication, it's like the radio station you're trying to broadcast is suddenly tuned to the right frequency and you don't have a lot of static to try to get past.) Did you have symptoms as a young child also? They may not have interfered with school, but were you a daydreamer, forgetful about chores, etc? I think you need to have had symptoms before age 12. And it's also not true that it improves with age. It can improve, but plenty of adults have enough symptoms to cause impairment. I read somewhere that after one's teens, one third of people with ADHD get better, one third stay the same, and one third get worse. The diagnosis isn't made by psychological testing alone--self report measures and reports from family members (your wife, for example) are a key part of the assessment. As long as you meet the criteria in the DSM V and there isn't anything else going on, that's how the diagnosis is made. Did this psychologist have expertise in adult ADHD? Based on what your account of what happened, I would be very surprised if you said he did. A psychiatrist with experience in treating ADHD can make the diagnosis (usually these are psychiatrists who also have training in child and adolescent psychiatry)--it often isn't necessary to have formal testing done unless you want accommodations and need \"proof\" that you have it. That's my understanding, anyway. I would say to trust your instincts and your research, and find a professional with the specific expertise that you need. They are out there.

Everyday he texts me in the morning and a little bit throughout the day, but we mostly talked at night. Today I texted him this morning and he never responded, which is not normal. All day I was really worried, nervous, anxious, on the verge of tears, even my stomach felt like it was in knots and I had no appetite and had to force myself to eat lunch (usually I’m starving), and I felt like I would puke or had to constantly use the toilet even though I knew I didn’t really have to. (These physical signs are brand new to me, usually it’s just the negative thoughts and emotions.) In the past, I’ve been ghosted without warning so that’s what I thought was happening today. These were the thoughts I had: What did I do wrong? Why doesn’t he like me anymore? Will I ever find anyone who will like me? (I’ve never had a relationship before and I’m almost 31 so that’s why I was thinking that.) Why is he ignoring me? I’ve never ignored him... Finally in the late afternoon, I couldn’t take these feelings anymore and I texted him. I saw he was active on social media throughout the day so that added to the anxiety. I was upset at this point, I felt like it was rude to ignore someone that long, especially when I don’t ignore him. So I said that was immature. And he responded with: What are you talking about? Now my brain just can’t understand his point of view. Didn’t he see the text? Didn’t he know he ignored it? Didn’t he know that he’s never done that before? So now it feels like I’m the wrong one here, although I wasn’t the rude one, he was. Now I feel like I need help for anxiety. I shouldn’t have to feel this way all day long over someone who might not care anymore. Is this social anxiety because it’s about a “relationship” and communication or is it general anxiety?

a long time, i was a complete failure. i had no friends, terrible relationships with my family, dropped out of high school because of anxiety, terrible self esteem, no job. everything was awful. over time, i got better. i got my GED and went back to school, started getting great grades, made great friends, got great jobs. even when things weren't great-- when i was struggling, suffering, or having other problems with mental health and self worth-- for years now, the one thing i've always been happy with and proud of is how well i've been doing with work and school. i have three amazing jobs in a very competitive field and have a great gpa. this has become such a huge part of my identity, my ability to do well in those areas. it has come to mean EVERYTHING to me. but now it's all falling apart. every part of my life has been tainted by this horrible mental anguish and exhaustion and anxiety i feel every day lately. i stopped going to classes this semester because i just couldn't leave my house anymore. started to isolate from my friends, telling them not to talk to me, ignoring their pleas to connect. now we're talking again, but every interaction just makes me want to cry. the more i talk to people i love, the worse i feel, and the more i break down and push them away with my crazy ######6 behavior. and for a while, even all of that was okay, because i thought i was still doing well at work, still doing okay in school when i went for tests. but at some point, even that stopped. after years and years of dedicated, non-stop school work and professional work, it's all falling apart. i've started to get terrible, failing grades in all my classes. zeros from absences, and from not handing things in. terrible test grades. i've gotten second chances from so many professors, and still end up failing because i don't take them. i just cant do anything i want to do anymore. every time i go into work, i can't do anything. i can barely get anywhere on time. i'm always rushing around at the last minute, or arriving late, and have been spoken to about my bad attendance at one job recently. i have never been spoken to for *any* disciplinary reason at *any* job before. last week, i went to work and had to leave early and had to have my coworker drive me home because i was so depressed and anxious and generally out of it (dissociative?) i could barely understand where i was or what i was doing. when i didn't feel like i was going to pass out, i felt like i was going to break down and sob hysterically. i felt so out of it and confused that i genuinely thought i may have had a focal seizure or something. my brain just stopped working all of the sudden. at another job, i straight up did not do something i was supposed to do.. and i don't even know why i didn't do it. i have no clue. it was an important thing, and i just didn't do it. and then this week, at that same job, i put something off for three days, and every day i was asked to do it, i said i would do it. and then, i didn't. and i didn't even explain why, or asked to put it off. i just didn't do it. and finally, at the job i care about the most, i slept through my ######6 shift this morning. i woke up 10 minutes before i had to be there to *teach a class*, and had to call and have someone there stop what they were doing to, at the very last minute, teach for me. cover me. because i can't even wake up on time anymore, when people really need me. i'm a ######6 disaster. i'm ######6 garbage. now, it's 3:00 AM, and i have a final at 9:00, and i just can't do my ######6 work. i can't. i can't do it. i'm so scared. i'm so panicked. i am failing and i don't know what to do. this class talked to me about my attendance WEEKS ago, and yet i still have not gone in since spring break. i don't even know if the final is actually tomorrow. i just think it is, based on the schedule. but i don't know for sure because i haven't even been in ######6 class. i don't know how to handle this. i am so ######6 scared. i have fallen so far behind in everything that i don't even know how to fix it anymore. the idea of sitting here and studying for this exam i have in 5 hours feels so overwhelming it makes me want to cry, because studying means i'll have to face exactly how much i've ###$ up and how much i've fallen behind. and how little i can do to fix it. i don't know who i am anymore. i don't know who i am or if i'm worth anything at all. my life was nothing for 95% of the time i've been alive. then, at the very last second, everything changed. everything got better. people said i was worth something. people cared about me, and were proud of me, for the first time. because i did well in school. because i got these great jobs. because i didn't ###$ up. even when i was really overwhelmed, i never ###$ up like this. never. i powered through. i got through every shift, and did well. i got through every class, and did well. and now i can't even submit ######6 homework. i can't even get above a 50 on a test. i was supposed to transfer to my dream school this fall, and now i don't think i'll be able to. i think this is going to ###$ it all up. i was supposed to graduate this summer. i don't think i can now. i think i'm ruining everything i've built for myself these past two years. i think i'm ######6 myself over in every situation. i think the people who used to be proud of me, used to praise me, used to trust me, are now being failed by me. i don't think i deserve any of the things i have. i think they're all going to go away. i think i'm going to be worthless again, and i'm not going to be able to rebuild this time. i'm so scared. i'm so scared. i don't want to ruin this. i don't want to break this. i don't want these people to abandon me. i don't want my bosses to be ashamed of me. i don't want them to get rid of me. i want them to be proud of me. i want to be proud of me. i want to know that i'm doing things right. i just want to do things right, but i never can, and this is so ######6 scary. it's hitting me so hard that i'm not good at anything anymore. at least before, when i was struggling, i could cling to this idea that at least objectively, superficially, professionally, academically, i was keeping afloat. i was preserving a good future for myself, for when i would feel better. but i can't even do that for myself anymore. i'm letting everything i love crash and burn all around me and i'm doing nothing to fix it, except screaming at myself as i lay down in my bed, screaming at myself to get up, screaming at myself to fix my stupid ######6 mistakes, my easily fixable mistakes, and watching my body fall asleep instead please help me. i just want someone to help me. i keep trying to go to therapists but it never works out, we never click and my schedule is always too crazy for me to justify seeing people who i don't have a good theraputic relationship with. i have a lot of trauma related problems and it makes it really hard to see therapists. unfortunately their attempts to help me can often be inadvertently triggering, and i leave. my last therapist i left earlier this spring because she tried to force me to talk about that trauma, she refused to continue seeing me unless i started to talk about it so i just stopped going. and now i'm supposed to be studying abroad this summer and moving in august so it feels like if i try to see someone again i'm going to have to leave the minute i get my first appointment with them. i'm on my own for all of june and i don't even know if i'm going to survive at the rate i'm going. everything is so scary. life is so scary. i am so scary. i am so scared of how capable i am of ruining my own life. i am so ###$ up. this is so ###$ up. please help me",

I'll just start with my story. I am a 24 year old male. I have what you can consider a happy life, got a good job, a loving girlfriend and family, no troubles whatsoever. So around 3 weeks ago, a friend came over to my place and we smoked some Marijuana (I am not a regular smoker, I maybe smoke once every 3 months.) It felt alright, but soon after I experienced what is called a horror-trip. In my head I had a feeling, that I couldnt explain to anyone, my body never felt that feeling before, it was a feeling of helplessness, fear, sadness and shock. After that night, i felt horrible the next day. The day after that I started feeling better, until some days ago, when that feeling came back. Immediately after that feeling hits, i start feeling really sad, and scared, it happens at random moments or before it hits. It is like a feeling, that i know something is wrong in my head, and I can feel it at the back of my head, my muscles start to shake, it is really uncomfortable, it kinda makes me want to cry. I've tried to search the Web, to see what it might be, the closest it gets to is anxiety. So I am here asking, is it true, does it stay with me forever, or is it just a temporary thing, my body trying to cope with it, since it never experienced that feeling before. I have no medical records of mental illnesses, I was fine, before I smoked it. Thank you for your answers in advance!", "hash": "4da60c2a2c8f0e593de3c039b24840f20972dd97a4648fd8cf683e048abc1538"}

I think I found a great community here. I'd like to say hello to all of you. The main reason I join this group is that I can't handle an issue in my life nowadays. I work from home with my husband in our home office. And we have a lovely African grey parrot since 2013. So we really got used to our parrot. She is with us day and night. She's our child especially for me. I have strong bonds with her. And on these days I feel these bonds very effectively, may be as strong as causing harmful effects. On these days we're planning to move to another country. This is a very good opportunity for us to have a better job. But unfortunately, we will not be able to take our parrot with us. Because its species is in the endangered species. And we have to prepare so many documents for her. Passport, health report, report from CITES and more. So maybe we can take her with us after one year when we settled there. Until this time, our family accepted to look after her. But I am very worried about that. Even they said us they can look after her, I don't feel better. I am very sorry that I leave her. And I constantly think about disaster scenarios. Like, she is falling into depression, she is thinking that we left her forever and we'll not get back to her, she's plucking her feathers and many more. I'm worried about her for 7/24 and I can not deal with it anymore. When I told that to my husband he said to me that we cannot take her with us. And he did not promise that we'll take her after one year. So that means there's not hope to take her with us. But I think I cannot live without her and I'll try to do that one year later. The thing is that I can't give her responsibility to someone else. I cannot trust someone else. I think our family cannot look after her like me. If something bad happens to her if she becomes ill, how can I blame them? They told me that they can send me pictures, videos and I can make video calls to see her but that's not relieving my mind. Do you have any suggestions for that? How can I do? Thanks and I appreciate any answer.", "hash": "1c07f3fc9c85e343eee57eb655c9d5d2fdd2528985d98834defeaca16ecdf2d2"}

Brief History: Husband and I have been married for 7 yrs, been together/lived together for 10 yrs. Very happily married, 2 kids, couldn't ask for anything more, except maybe winning the lotto. I've never cheated on him, or even flirted with other guys. I am quite the recluse, not many friends, don't get out much, stay at home mom. The problem lies in my 'relationships' before him. For some reason they really bother him. It's not a constant thing. He can go a long time w/out thinking about it, but then something (don't know what) will trigger the thought, and he obsesses about it. Sometimes (like now) it gets so bad he has trouble functioning because he can't get the obsessive thoughts out of his head. Technically, he is the only man I have ever dated. My past 'relationships' that bother him consist of: When I was 17, I met a man off the internet, he was 28, and had sex with him. I went back 2-3 times. It was a low point in my life, I have self-esteem issues, and I didn't think it would matter. I had no feelings for the man, wasn't even attracted to him. The second guy, was a friend, and we didn't have sex, I just spent the night with him, and yes, we fooled around a bit, but both decided we didn't want to go any further. That's the extent of my sexual relationships before my husband. At first, years ago, when he mentioned it bothered him, I thought it was the circumstances of the first guy, but now I don't think it would matter who it was, or what the circumstances were. Sometimes when he obsessives about it, he doesn't want anything to do with me. Other times, it's like he's marking his territory (which trust me, I don't mind) where he's pulling me aside to have sex 3-4 times a day. I kinda like the possessiveness of it, but he told me it bothers him becuause we should be making love out of love, not because he's trying to 'erase' any other guy that's been there before him. How do I help him deal with this? I try to be supportive and just remind him that I love him, but it's not enough. Most people would just say get over it, it was before you, but I can't do that, I can see how much it effects him, and I love him too much to belittle his feelings.", "hash": "d22702d4df406881ebb683d925fc0c9594ce05ffb3dfb19bb310c3d2ea6ad817"}

It’s called Retroactive Jealousy and can be thought of as kind of like an OCD condition. My husband is also suffering - and making me suffer - from this condition. For 10 years of our marriage he has every so often bought up my past and called me horrible names. The particular event that he is obsessed with happened about a year before I met him. I was horribly drunk to the point of being unconscious and was taken advantage of by 2 men (boys really at the time). I didn’t report it to the police and instead internalised the blame and shame for it. One night when I was really comfortable with my one day to be husband I told him of that event and how awful I felt about it. He shared secrets with me too. But ever since then he has tried to blackmail me into having a threesome because apparently I did it with them why not him? And lately it has come around to me wanting it, not a sexual assault. I have only just come across this condition, and if you google it it will explain what is going on in their heads. I have been put on trial by my husband for years, with any previous information I have given him being held against me. He calls me names and says horrible things to me. But now I know why. If you are in this situation please google retroactive jealousy and if you are unsafe, leave. And for gods sakes, see a counsellor. We shouldn’t have to be defending ourselves for things we did well before we met our partners. It’s not right.", "hash": "b210f0bfda5b03e446bdc5e39cc9406cfadc246a77cf1073dc8774bb0415fb2c"}

I have feelings of some anxiety most of the time and more intense anxiety during stressful situations. It seems like the stroke took away some protection from anxiety. I have been on Wellbutrin off and on for years, taking 100mg twice a day with no side effects. It has generally helped my mild depression. I went to see my doctor about the anxiety and he had me take 7.5, mg of Buspar twice a day. I experienced dizzy/faint feelings for the whole three weeks I was on it. I went to see my doctor again and he took me off the Buspar and gave me the 300mg Wellbutrin hoping that would help with the anxiety, it made it worse. I called in and they suggested taking the Buspar once a day with the Wellbutrin . I think this has helped with the anxiety a little but I still have it and the dizziness/faintness has returned.

The issue as I see it is that I am not quick on my feet in discussions or social situations. Or a better description is that I sometimes speak quickly but without thinking sufficiently leading to gross inaccuracies. I am effective though in problem solving but typically by myself. Grades back in school have always been very good. Thinking before I speak in group or tense situations has always been difficult. Some anxiety exists.

So i finished this one last Wednesday and from Thurs-morning to now I have these really strong thoughts I think i just need to know what happened in certain scenes exactly so i end up going back and watching those scenes over and over but it doesn't help too much because probably an hour or so later I'm trying to picture that scene or several how they were displayed in my mind but i'm guessing this is an impossible task. So this time around it's quite intense allot more than the others i have about 10 scenes from all sorts of episodes flicking through my mind thing is it's weird because sometimes I don't really want them to go in case i forget what happens in those scenes. I have an intense urge now to check through them again which would require me to go through probably 3 episodes to find them again so I'm wasting allot of time in the day at the moment and if i don't go to check them I have insane anxiety untill i do. I don't know if it mainly gets triggered from a good story or something because it doesn't happen all the time but only sometimes on certain shows.", "hash": "542c9d89dd4d8ac52ca61e4a52a616323b8b6811df5cfdfa0548152e7a336fe0"}

I digged too deeply in the reality of the world and now I have seen the truth. About a week ago i started having a series of disturbing thoughts regarded the world and how it is a ###$ up place. Thoughts on random fears and thoughts that life is suffering filled my mind and I could not stop or refute them. One thing led to another and now a new thought has absolutely broken me. I am agnostic. I do not believe in religion or their gods. But I never fell into the trap of nihilism that without a god that there is no point.in life. I used to strongly believe in right and wrong and why life is valuable. But I have now lost that thing that kept me falling into the abyss. As I sat ruminating over my thoughts trying to find counter arguments to the thoughts about life was suffering and stuff, an new thought came into my head, that aliens will probably not have the same emotions as us. This led me into a downward spiral of if aliens didnt have the same emotions as us than emotions are not universal. If emotions are not universal than emotions are nothing more than evolutionary adaptions to help our species survive. And then finally if emotions are nothing more than evolutionary adaptions, then then things like love or value does not exist. Human life is not special or important. Love isnt because you actually love a person, its because evolution is trying to pass on your genes. Emotions are illusions. Humans are nothing more than machines of evolution. There is no reason for emotions or caring about other people. I never thought this way before. I always believed in humanism, that humans are special and deserve to be treated well. I believed in love, happiness and morality. Now those concepts have been dragged out from underneath me. It doesnt matter if someone gets murdered or raped. Human life isn't special. Just evoutionary robots. I was already pretty emotionless because I was dealing with the thoughts before coming to this realization but when the thought popped into my head it's like something inside me died. I feel nothing anymore. No emotions. Nothing. Life is worthless and so are emotions. I have become a robot. For the past few days I have done nothing but read philosphy books and books by a philosopherscientist named Raymond Tallis. He has what I think are convincing thoughts on why evolution, while true, can not account for human behavior or emotions. That humans are more than their biological roots. But no matter how many times I read and read, while I agree with his statements, the thoughts don't care. The thoughts don't believe it. I still believe that life is worthless. If an asteroid came and destroyed the planet tomorrow I would not care. I realize how horrible that statement sounds but I can't help. It won't leave my mind. I am constantly searching for evidence against these thoughts but no matter how much I can logically agree with the counter arguments, I can't force my self to believe it. I am constantly reading stuff on the internet to disprove these thoughts but nothing works. I hate this. Why am I like this? I am worried that I will be a sociopath for the rest of my mind. That I will resort to acting like the animal I believe we all are. I want to reset my mind, or rewind time to a time I did not think like this. I have OCD but I don't think this applies here. I have no emotions anymore. I am just an evolutionary robot. Please someone read this and slap some sense into me. I'm so scared.", "hash": "fea3ffdf33fd983efad804be8374a912361792ad2e67b91e9b5d4bb037a6ef81"}

ALL of us. It's just a matter of where you are on the scale. It seems to me you are one of the rare occurrences of an intellectual epiphany. From what I understand from reading your post, you are prone to being highly intellectual, always thinking, always wondering, always analyzing. This is what makes those who make this world and create all that we have. In other words, you aren't one of the billions of sheep on this planet. You have a working mind, and an aggressively questioning intellect. Welcome to the club.....been there, done that, bought the T-shirt, went home. LOL Actually, I'm STILL there. My mind has never stopped. And yes, I too have had the same type of thoughts passing through my mind over the years. It can be very demanding on your psyche', and it can be very strenuous on your personality and emotional state. And even though you may not \"feel\" like you have emotions at this point, you still do. Your just overwhelming yourself with all of this new information, and it's buzzing in your brain without any conceptual connections to anything at this point. You're becoming more sentient of the world and the universe. You are seeing reality and truth in nature, instead of continually believing all the BS, lies, fantasies, and other sanctimonious garbage you've been brainwashed with all your life. What you have to start doing at this point is sifting through it all. Take it one piece at a time, analyze it, research it, get the information you need on it, in order for it to make sense to you and be content with the answer or outcome of your research. Then go on to the next piece of information rattling around in your brain and do the same. If you start organizing all of this into categories in your head, you can better filter the crap from reality. You have to discover what the lies are, and what the reality is. Logic and reason. The two BEST research tools anyone can ever use in life. You cannot hide logic. It's there in your face, whether you want to believe it or not. It is an absolute. Reason will help guide your research to a logical state of understanding and comprehension. To para-phrase Mr. Sherlock Holmes..........When you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. For this situation, all the \"impossible\" is all the lies, BS, and fantasy that people have created to live in their own little worlds, with their heads up their butts, refusing to see or admit to any sort of reality. You've got to sift through the BS to find the logic. You've got to sift through all the lies and fantasies you've been brainwashed with since birth, in order to get any reasonable understanding from it. This is how humans are. They ignore what is harmful to them. They refuse to see reality because it is hard fact, and most all humans cannot fathom fact, truth, or reality. It scares them. They hide from it with platitudes, witticisms, phony feelings, fake emotions, and plastic personalities. Aliens aside......all living things have different emotional states. If you are of the more scientific persuasion, then \"feelings\" and \"emotions\" are nothing more than chemical reactions in your brain, giving you different outcomes from the different sources crossing your daily path. Food is another source of chemical reaction that can have a lot do with your \"emotions\" and \"feelings\", as food is nothing but chemicals arranged in a different manner, which have different effects on different humans. As a concept, this would mean all living things never have the same feelings or emotional states, as they all have different environments and are fed different foods to live. Hmmm, does that make any sense? Sometimes it's hard to put this stuff into words. What is truth? Logic would dictate that truth and logic are one in the same. Both are absolutes, which cannot be disproven by any means. It just IS. It is undeniable fact. Example: The rock is hard. You can fantasize, theorize, and scrutinize the rock all you want and wonder about it all you want.......but the cold, hard, undeniable truths are, it's a rock, and it's hard. Hopefully thats not oversimplifying the point too much. Your brain and intellect are waking up from the cold, sour encasement of lies, fantasies, and BS that's been pounded into your mind and psyche' all your life so far. And instead of burying it deeper and becoming more sheep like, you are wondering and contemplating. WOOHOO!!! Alright!!! This will take time. But your first step is to find a way to organize all of these thoughts in your head. It's now time to find your truths.", "hash": "acfc0f1ff93120e0ffde1d6215b062ee5ae0eb29207069b8d1a611f9fd2c8a95"}

One of my major insecurities is low number of sexual partners. It just makes me feel incapable of doing anything and usually I lie the count to be bigger than it is, cause in case I get in bed with someone I can just blame them for bad sex or usually just get wasted. But usually when someone approaches me in a sexual way I get this feeling of anxiety that I have no idea what I'm doing and since I'm a guy it's rather a major concern. Usually leading to a situation where I rabbit out with an excuse, cause I don't want to get embarrassed. Also the high performance stress that spikes in usually makes me incapable of enjoying sex yet the amount that I desire it just grows by year by year. Actually I just grave it so much today that I might flirt to random strangers and touch of other people, but yet usually this leads to other people find this creepy or rabbit out by themselves and if it leads to sexual stuff I usually again rabbit out at the last moment. I think I've done the rabbit thing now over 10 times ( like pass out or just I can't do this or ). Also have commitment issues cause I strongly belief that if other people knew how screwed up I am they'd leave me on the spot so I rather just not get too close with anyone. I've thought of using sex worker services, but I'm not sure would that make my self-esteem even more worse since I could rabbit out even with them so I thought I'm going to go with the traditional way. But it's rather hard since I'm already 26 and only had like sex three times where I kinda dissociated from it and saw it as a mechanical performance and yes I have never had an orgasm. Thanks. Feel a lot better even by now.", "hash": "8e6771b7feadfced83b99528dc2ae88a98a88ebb75692b25028bd1ab73aeb794"}

Was doing fine throughout these years, minus the usual mild brain fog and worry/nervous. It wasn't until recently in October where I was playing a game on my cell phone and out of nowhere I felt odd/dizzy looking up from my cell and that resulted in the feeling that I felt when I was 17 - A week later, I woke up quickly and felt a dizziness that I never felt before, which resulted in a mild panic feeling. I went to the hospital because I couldn't shake that dizziness off - I'd lay down and felt dizzy, I'd walk and feel dizzy, and with feeling, not \"normal\" it made me anxious. They ran some test, everything in my brain is fine and they said I had vertigo. Gave me medication for when I'd feel dizzy and ignored the whole anxiety/panic aspect. I still have brain fog these days and by not feeling \"here\" and \"cloudly\" it puts me in a bad spot. Now, what I want to know how do you guys feel during an anxiety or panic attack? Is what I go through a feeling associated with anxiety or panic? Could it be something else? What medications do you guys take that work without feeling like a zombie?

{"url": "https://www.psychforums.com:443/generalized-anxiety/topic210137.html", "text": "Terrified of winding up all alone? by Roseredpinball » Sun Oct 28, 2018 2:22 am Hello all, ever since I was a young child I have been acutely aware of my status as youngest in the family. That is, I've always had this recurrent, intrusive, thought/fear that someday I will wind up all alone because my parents and both my older brothers will die before me. As a kid I had rather bad separation anxiety, and now I wonder if I still have it? Like I said, I'm terrified of someday being all alone because my parents and probably both my older brothers will pass on before I do. I have friends, but we've all been pretty distant since we graduated from high school and now only see each other a couple times a year, except for my closest and longest term friend, whom I see at least once a week when we hang out. I'm in college, but I haven't really made any friends, even though I'm in my fourth year and already thinking about graduation and the possibility of further education. I made a few friends I guess, but you could hardly call them friends and we don't really talk much if at all anymore. I did make one friend in college whom I do see as an actual friend and used to talk more to but he took a year off, and since we haven't been talking as much. I have bad social anxiety, so it's extremely difficult for me to make friends. Besides, even if I were to make friends that's no guarantee that they won't also die before me or move away. I've been on a few dates but I've never really had a boyfriend, though I would like to someday get married. Still, no offence, but men don't usually live as long as women, so I would probably still wind up alone... The thought of being alone terrifies me, if I'm all alone who will I turn to for reassurance or comfort when I have a bad panic attack or other bad things happen to me? I also have a phobia of vomiting, so I'm terrified of being somewhere/in a situation where might be ill and there is no one there to help me. (I'm also terrified of getting so scared that I throw up and there's no one there to calm me down so I won't throw up.) Suffice to say, I'm terrified of many things. Besides that, just being alone in general seems like such an awful thing. But, ironically, I think my fear of being alone had contributed to my being alone now. I avoid getting close to others, don't really take care of my personal hygiene, and, I admit, probably spend more time than I should surfing the internet or playing video games just to avoid facing the reality of getting rejected or growing close to someone only to lose them later on because I just can't stand the thought of losing the ones I care about. I do these things to avoid the reality that I am alone, I think, because it's easier. But if that is the case then... what can I do? How can I change this? The thought of losing the ones I care about is almost too much to bear. Picturing my parents, especially my mother (who has always been there for me and helped me calm down from panic attacks), is almost too painful for me to even think about. I've always preferred fantasy to real life because fantasy is so much safer and real life is so dull and boring and too painful. I often feel unworthy of others' time and affection, I feel like I have nothing to offer others, and besides that I often find it difficult to be vulnerable around others and when I do open up and reveal potentially embarrassing/intimate things about myself I always end up regretting it. This is why I just avoid making friends. Sorry for the long, rambling post, but if anyone has any experience with this or ideas, please, help me.", "hash": "b6776c254a8a3886d4b11ddb70ada15a39c4d6dc52b9cd109315e029f5808875"}

Only child. Still live at home. Middle class, never had \"real\" money problems, spoiled throughout my life. LONG STORY. NO TL;DR. HELP A BROTHER OUT. Parents: Mother: Overprotective. Not severely, comically so, but enough to matter. Scared that something will happen to me pretty much always. Pretty sure this has damaged my self esteem in some way. Is not terribly happy herself. Actually, her happiness is too much depending on my happiness. She does tasks / chores for me sometimes before I even have a chance to do them myself. Has not taught me to do these things myself. Has no clue how to help properly support me so I can turn into a functional, competent adult and instead will just get angry when things turn sour. Also, because my mother cannot talk to my father properly, she would sometimes talk to me instead as a \"replacement\". This wasn't healthy either. She also made my father look bad on purpose at times. Father: \"Absent\" (not physically) after age 14-15. Realized he is not to blame. He simply cannot engage with people on an actual meaningful level, only sporadically. Keeps himself busy at all times. Very non judgmental however (at least towards me). Cannot understand the viewpoint of my mother and my mother often provokes him and he consistently falls for the same traps. His defense mechanism is to become extremely stubborn. He can also be manipulative but he doesn't to a good job of covering this up. Also diagnosed with ASD, which makes sense, but then there are some things that don't fit that picture (I guess that is normal?) Other family: I hardly have any other family. In the past a bit more. But the amount of people really influencing me in my life has been quite limited. Of course friends / school did play an important role (early on). My main problems are: I cannot find something I want to study or do for a career. The reason for this is complex, not due to one particular thing. On the one hand, I probably am a little bit of a special snowflake if you will. I do not care about how people view such a statement, I am only interested in laying out the facts. In primary school I was the smartest kid in my (small) class. I felt good about myself at that time, despite being shy in nature. I had interactions with lots of different kids and had a couple of friends I would see fairly regularly also outside school. First three years of high school were pretty much decent too. After that there was puberty and I had various bad experiences with some quite awful people that made me extremely socially anxious. I did not focus on my grades much during this time, more on survival. My family tried to help but they failed to do so in a way that actually helped me. I really had to fend for myself. I was super scared to admit many things I thought and felt, which is common with the disorder. I desperately prayed that someone would see through my various smokescreens, but they did not. Since puberty I have had some problems / behaviors that to this day I have not been able to deal with. I feel horrible about this fact, actually, rather before I felt horrible about this fact. A few months ago I experienced something fairly intense which made me re-feel the importance of love. This has reduced my tendency somewhat to destroy myself inside because of my shortcomings. Anyway, my most severe problem or symptom rather is severe chronic procrastination. I can guarantee it is the worst case in existence (I should be studied by scientists no joke). Goes back PARTLY to the point above: I do not know what I want. I have always been interested in the technical, computers, cars, somewhat engineering in general. But I am not naturally drawn to academia. In fact since puberty, I do not like studying anymore. Or rarely. There are a handful exceptions. No I have to be honest. I do not like studying. The whole concept seems unreal to me. I still feel like I am in high school. Jeez. 25 and still taking tests, sitting in class I have had enough. But I am not educated enough to get a tolerable job that makes little more than minimum wage money (ok it might be a bit better than that but not by much). Ok what I mean by PARTLY: at some point, when stress is low, I do enjoy studying certain topics. Even more difficult math type stuff (not a natural at math). But it does not last. And when the point of no return is reached, that is now, meaning I have procrastinated too long, I start hating everything. I probably conflate these two things. But like I said I REALLY do not have the ability to properly govern / control this behavior. It is a deep problem. I cannot get myself to commit myself like a normal person to studying honestly 3 - 4 hours a day without #######4 or excuses. IMPOSSIBLE. I enjoy doing my own thing. Heck, I enjoy living in my own little world. No restrictions. Get to do what I want, by my rules. As a kid, playing with lego, these were the most satisfying experiences for me. Hours would pass by in minutes. I love taking computers apart and upgrading them. I love flashing ROMs on Android devices. I love obsessively tinkering with $#%^ for no reason, for no purpose. See, it will never make any money. But it satisfies me deeply. I don't care. Nobody is telling me to do it, only me. And yes, I have realized I DO enjoy this. I love artists who create music in this way. Klayton of Celldweller, Trent Reznor from Nine Inch Nails. They seem like musical tinkerers to me. They think like me. I love those guys to death, for real. I do not have the dedication to creating music that they have, at least not now. I wish I did though. So college. I did / do not like it (just like school, but one huge upside is that there are not \"politics\" or cliques and bs social rules). In college, you can work with teams, for instance on building a racing car to compete against other teams. But I never enjoy this. I can never do what I want. Always restrictions. Fixed rules, fixed dynamics in place that stifle my freedom. That's why I prefer to stay inside. I enjoy this. Some would say this is wrong but it is really my nature. Goes back to playing with lego. Or video games. Oh god, video games. I can't really play them, because then it has to be full time. It is either full time or very little to nothing. I used to be embarrassed about myself all the time. And my god, do I NOT measure up to what I should be. What kind of pathetic, weak excuse for a man am I??! Except I do not care. I do not care about such judgements anymore, and it has been freeing. However, I still cannot for the life of me figure out what I should do with myself career wise. Currently have no friends or girlfriend. Everything is in my past. I am considering rekindling a friendship which goes wayyyy back, I owe this person an explanation. But not right now, when the time is right. Oh, and never had a girlfriend before either. Zero experience with women. But my mindset has shifted. I am giving myself all the space and time I need. And worst case, if it never happens, I will still accept myself. I will try to do what I can. If I can help just one person, just one in a genuine way, I feel like my life is justified. My procrastination is the reason I do not have friendships, because I constantly have to lie to people about where I am really at or where my head is at. And I hate doing this so much, especially for the other person. That's why I have finally decided to not involve other people in my $#%^ anymore until I have this a little bit more figured out. The desire to help people makes me think of Psychology, but in my mind, I am not convinced that pursuing Psychology, and then becoming a therapist for instance, is truly going to make me feel like I genuinely help people. I imagine such a situation to be very difficult. Some people I could help really well, while the majority I would honestly not feel I would have much to offer to. Maybe I am wrong. This also what draws me to music, because music has saved me in the past. That feeling is overwhelming. Peak experience in life I would say. To give that to others would mean much more to me than owning the latest smartphone, having a 700 hp car (ok that's pretty awesome) or a large house. I imagine that to be deeply satisfying. Closing thoughts. Am about to fail what I am currently studying because I have two weeks to catch up on pretty much everything. Which is suicide. Only a miracle could save this. So basically I should open my mind to new possibilities. PS. Some bad character traits that seem to be constant over time: I get frustrated fairly easily, give up fairly easily. If something doesn't interest me, it is extremely difficult for me to do it. In primary school this was never a problem, as everything was super easy. So I just finished everything as fast as I humanly could, so I could start the fun times!!!!! Which was goofing off with other kids or hacking the school computers to change the high score in a .txt file and putting my name at the top of the list with a score of 10000000000!!!! Good times.", "hash": "1a4802c70567eacd544f54d8405721d798aeba30280eb684945428f987745739"}

I am a 24 year old woman with GAD, depression, and bpd. My boyfriend and I moved into our apartment about a year ago and we're struggling to pay rent. My boyfriend is working really hard as a landscaper, but we are still struggling to pay bills and rent. For a while I was thinking of going on disability but I'm not sure anymore. It seems impossible and time consuming to get and I want to start earning money as soon as possible. I'm trying my best to work up the courage to get a job but I honestly don't know if I can do it. The last time I worked was about 3 years ago and I had a traumatic experience where my ex/coworker harassed me at work every day and I had to leave my job. After that when I moved to a different store I started having panic attacks so frequently that it prevented me from doing my job. I stopped working with customers because of frequent panic attacks and agoraphobia and social anxiety and started stocking shelves instead but one day I took a bottle of aspirin off the shelf and just went to the bathroom and took the whole bottle (my second suicide attempt). That was about 2 years ago I believe? I would like to believe I am ready to hold a job now and I desperately need one so I'm trying to remain positive. After that happened I've been extremely reclusive, moreso than ever. My social anxiety and agoraphobia has greatly increased and I believe I'm developing an eating disorder (or an obsession with food and my weight at the very least). I don't leave my apartment often unless I'm with my boyfriend or if I know I won't have to talk to anyone. It's gotten to the point where I can't make eye contact with anyone. I can't even wave to strangers or say hello. I'm riddled with guilty and anxiety over not having a job. I can't take feeling like a failure and a waste of space much longer so I asked my friend to help me get a job where he works. I'm supposed to call today and I didn't sleep last night because I've been so anxious about that alone. I want to believe I can do this, but I just don't know. My boyfriend is very kind and understanding when it comes to my issues and my not having a job, which only makes me feel even guiltier. Does anybody have any advice? How can I make myself do this? Thank you guys", "hash": "3d7aed7a4508ed5aafaa5299e1b143cd8285ae8b6151bc308fd20eab3abde612"}

I lost my dad almost 5 years ago to illness which is what my anxiety is related to and stems from. This alternate reality is filled with people I look up to, mainly youtubers I admire and wish I was friends with. They have changed over the years but have been consistent for the past 2. They all have specific spots in my room that they 'sit' and I talk to them all out loud. In my daydream I am older and have a whole elaborate backstory for myself. This includes moving to Canada and picking up the accent, so when I'm in my alternate reality I speak in a Canadian accent. All the relationships I have created in my little world are long term (like 6-7 years), and it makes me wonder if part of the reason I do this is to fill the emptiness I felt after losing my dad. Being in this daydream feels so good, I am more confident, I still have anxiety but I talk about it a lot more freely in my own world, and whenever I feel anxious or any other intense emotion, thats where I go. more recently I've started to feel ashamed in the middle of my daydream or when I come out of it, because I take a step back and realize how crazy I must look since I'm literally having a conversation with different patches of air. its not as though I actually see the people I want to see sat in front of me, I just imagine them and talk to them as if they were actually in the room. I am very strict with myself about where I do this, as I said it only really exists in my room. Sometimes if I'm home alone I'll use the accent around the house just to talk to myself, and during long car journeys I fantasize about it but thats as far as it goes. I realize how insane I must sound, but its bothered me for a while and I'm too embarrassed to talk about it, so as always I'm turning to the internet for some reassurance and some answers. does anybody else do this or something similar? does anybody know why I do this?

I think for me it was escapism from bullying due to developmental delays (since birth). For me it took many forms. As a young child I'd create characters/persona's based on popular kids who didn't get bullied. As a teen it would include favourite celebrities/pop stars and I'd be their hero. (by saving their lives or doing something heroic). Up to this point it stayed exclusively in my bedroom. In my late teens was when my first 'persona' became a full blown alter and existed in the real world, based on a deaf kid I met on a visit to a deaf school who signed who I got obsessed with. I had a phobia of public speaking due to a speech defect and being bullied for it and was already an elective mute in some situations so this 'becoming deaf so no-one expected me to speak' seemed like the perfect solution to me. (I'd explain here I also have autism and dissociation was my 'coping strategy, though I did not understand this at that age). In my 'imaginings' as I used to call them I was also deaf and signed fluently by learning to sign songs. Again my TV heroes would be in my fantasies and of course they'd think I was amazing and learn to sign to communicate with me etc! This continued to my thirties when a sudden 'shut down' causing (at the time) temporary mobility issues triggered an obsession with wheelchair users after being treated like a celebrity in hospital when I couldn't walk. My fantasies then included me being in a wheelchair after risking my life to save favourite tv celebrities. My mobility did eventually partly-recover (irl). I still need wheelchair/scooter for distance but can now walk round the house most days. (unless I'm having a severe sciatica attack - last one left me bedbound for a month) The body also has arthritis and circulation issues (causing legs to swell and general pain and stiffness on a daily basis - of varying degree some days are better than others). Though I'm glad people are talking about mental health more I won't be telling any of my neighbours I have autism or spend my life 'locked in fantasy' (They were told what I considered to be an acceptable cover story when I moved here as to why I used a wheelchair - 'rare neurological disorder' to basically cover any symptom they might think was unusual!).

I’ve been previously diagnosed with GAD and Major Depressive Disorder; Recently I’ve been experiencing intense anxiety while at work. I feel as if people such as supervisors and coworkers are watching me work and this causes anxiety/tension. I feel like I have to not mess up and this causes me to feel like I lock up, when I try to ignore the anxiety I feel it just makes it worse and I feel like I can tell they know I’m acting differently which makes it worse. It causes me to self isolate to feel better; This doesn’t happen all the time but recently it has kicked up again and I’m afraid to tell my doctor because I’m afraid he will tell me I’m paranoid or something. Idk if it’s just me worrying too much and my mind just building on the worry creating the anxiety. I’m finding it hard to interact with people as my social anxiety recently has skyrocketed Any thoughts if stress at work could be causing me to become paranoid or does this just sound like excessive worry?

Almost clockwork. Negative symptoms include such things as insomnia, suicidal ideation, reduced productivity, impulse spending, distancing from friends and family, weight gain and irrational thoughts. My concern is, what would generally last around a month, is now approaching 5. This resulted in me seeing the crisis team on Thursday and a subsequent trip to the GP to collect my first lot of medication since 2012! The crisis team feel as though my initial diagnosis (2012) of EUPD is no longer appropriate and that I need further intervention from the complex care team to further ascertain a new or revised diagnosis. They are leaning towards a suggestion of severe anxiety, however they have stated that the cyclic nature of my problem is throwing a spanner in the works so to speak. Anyway, moving on. The GP has given me a short supply of 5mg Diazepam to help with the initial hit of anxiety and insomnia. Running parallel to this I've been given the usual dose of 50mg Sertraline SSRI so that by the time I get to see the complex care team, I'll have a level of meds in my system. I only started the Diazepam last night, took 5mg in the afternoon and 10mg before bed. I'm quite disappointed, although it has certainly taken the edge of the anxiety initially and gave me a general level of clarity - it has not helped with my insomnia. I am also mindful that it is a short term fix due to the tolerance and dependancy levels. So, my question is, after this rant, long term, what medication are people having fortune with in terms of severe anxiety, depression and insomnia? I'm hoping they will allow me to keep the Diazepam 5mg as a PRN alongside a proven SSRI but I know GPs can be hesitant to script the benzos. Anyone have experience with this also?", "hash": "b73915e08df98e18fab5a8abffa02cec06a6b45627b2bf8c980781aae4be778a"}

I had a pretty miserable life post marriage. I was married at 21, had my first born at 22. I was exceptionally good academically and had a very happy childhood and very supportive, loving parents. However, my in laws are from hell. My husband was a total mama's boy and simply never stood up for me. He was raised as a total slave to their whims and commands. His father is clearly a narcissist and his mother a manipulative emotional wreck. I got sucked into this whirlpool mess of a family. His brother and spouse are extremely selfish, greedy people who have used us and betrayed our trust. Yeah, lovely family right? I don't know when exactly it started but I developed severe anxious thoughts, fears and health issues. I had witnessed as a teen my older cousin's erratic behaviour as he had schizophrenia but it didn't bother me then. I was pretty strong emotionally and could handle such expeeiences. Or so I thought. After marriage and two kids, I moved to another country and I started feeling lonely. I actively avoid close friendships although I used to be a social butterfly in college. I started becoming fearful every time my kids fell sick. It didn't help that successive vacations to my in laws' place were miserable, filled with conflicts and my kids witnessed it all. Now I'm wrecked with an unimaginable amount of guilt, it eats me day and night, that I screwed up my kids. I yell at them one minute, am loving and repentant the next. It's a rollercoaster ride and as they're growing older, they are feeling the effect. I always worry that my confusing and unpredictable behaviour and parenting, coupled with my personality and family history (although not direct) will cause my kids to get some mental illness. I'm particularly scared out of my mind about schizophrenia. I don't know so many intrusive thoughts full my head from the time I wake to when I crash at night that some horrible mental illness is lurking around my family. On top of that, I read these new agey stuff that what you think manifests as the energy is attracted to you. Now I'm double scared that I'm responsible for all these possible scenarios. On the outside people think I'm smart, articulate, capable, strongand a great mom, on the inside I'm an absolute wreck. I keep looking at my older son watching for any abnormal \"signs\". Once I caught him saying something in the bathroom and I froze. It turned out he was just speaking to someone on the phone. But this suspicious way of thinking and living is definitely something they'll pick up on as its getting too obvious. I hate feeling this way. I know I'm lonely, far away from my family and can't talk about these years even to my sister or husband as they sound really irrational. I have cut away my social circle, lost my motivation in my career and multiple talents, and just worry all the time. It used to be sporadic when the kids were younger but now it's getting worse as my older son approaches his adulthood and I'm anxious that I may have screwed him up. I feel he can sense my anxiety and I know it's really unhealthy for him. He also gets agitated and thinks I'm nagging him, when all I'm doing is making sure he's \"ok\" and all \"normal\". This is a horrible way to live and I can't even enjoy my children or their lives as I'm monitoring every behaviour of theirs, to satisfy my fears. Please help with some perspective on what I should do.", "hash": "6f72130872df4190951d025384ddd3a0ea84cd8e979f75ddedf9cda065f03af4"}

Let me first tell you that I have always had a thing for mental associations. I can look at something or listen to a song and experience strong feelings towards it or have vivid associations, be it with real-life things or fantasy places in my head. It's never been a problem for me, I've had it all my life, and it actually helps me with my creative work and I think I am able to paint abstract pictures because of my abilities to \"feel\". However, recently I started experiencing very bizarre associations. It al began about 4 years ago when I was on the internet and saw a particular artwork on an artist's website. It was an interesting, comic-like protrait of someone and I felt intrigued by it. It had many details and I started looking into them, and then suddenly I started feeling very uneasy. It was as if the picture was emitting bad vibes, so I closed the website didn't look at it again. Since then, I've started getting these exact same \"bad vibes\" that the picture had from other things as well (but not always): street lights throwing light at snow, graffitti on brick walls, some of the 80s synth-pop music (bizarrely) and so on. Every time it sends chills down my spine. From what I could find on the Internet, it kind of fits the description of PTSD when certain things can trigger traumatic memories. The problem is: I don’t have any traumatic memories that could fit into this! I have no idea why these random things keep triggering me, even though it does feel like I have a personal connection with them. A friend jokingly suggested that I could be experiencing memories from my past life. Well, I’m not really buying this theory, and I want to find the psychological explanation behind this. Oh, and the most bizarre thing about this is that I experience these \"bad vibes\" only in late autumn and winter , when it is already dark outside. In summer, I almost forget about these experiences and struggle to remember what the fuss was all about. However, today I had my first confrontation with this feeling again, so I guess the season is opened again. I was listening to some 80s music and suddenly had a strong the feeling of dread. These attacks usually last for a few seconds but can leave me anxious for minutes or hours, depending on how much I focus on it. Does anyone have any clue what it could be and how I could cope with it?", "hash": "c72290cbc09f00a01e910edf8d7d919a1ff72f7eaea1a8cee07d547d558db778"}

My reason for asking: A few days ago, my mom asked me if i \"couldn't speak\" I'm assuming her boyfriend was upset that i went three days without saying anything to him, so he told her about it (i dont see him often since my room is in its own little area, I speak to him if he says something to me, but apparently me not speaking first is a problem for him, even though he is aware of my anxiety; we have had issues in the past with him being sensitive when it comes to these things.) My thing is, I do this with everyone, because speaking is such a weird thing for me, most of the talking i do is through text, i avoid people at all costs and this is one of the reasons why; people tend to misunderstand me, or just not hear me (which is what started this, he said something and i replied, and he didnt hear me, so he stopped talking to me for those three days, which if you ask me comes across as \"just leave me be and I'll speak to you when im ready\" so that's what i did, a big mess ended up happeneing from this and i spent 3 hours having a crying fit trying to calm myself down, and i just cant stop thinking about it now) we currently aren't speaking, which I'm okay with, my mom made some comments that made me feel weird because she has never spoken to me the way she has started doing since being with him. Sorry for the long-ish all over the place rant-post, but it just seems so odd; for me when i speak to someone and they dont reply i dont get upset and say they're selfish or whatever else, i just automatically think they either: have a lot going on, just don't want to speak, are as shy/awkward as i am, or just didn't hear me; i dont get upset, then sic my friends on them making a big fuss about it all, i just go about my day being worried about if my tone was rude or weird or if i made a mean face or if my body language was wrong, not if they're stuck up and rude, etc. Now, to me i feel like this would all be justified if he spoke to me and i ignored him, but i didn't do that, and my mom is saying that i \"walk around as if i expect everyone to just talk to me\" but that's what he does, he has a little fit when someone doesn't speak to him, but he can do it to other people whenever he wants. Lastnight, i said goodnight to everyone and he was the only one that didn't respond. So at this point, i don't want to waste any of my energy trying to hold a conversation with him to make him happy, this year hasn't been the best when it comes to the two of us, so i feel like it's just downhill from here.", "hash": "f960549295750fe576384704ea15583e2fe43f14e9f4c9e0bde7b45826a01e4b"}

I am suggesting that you don't like your mother's boyfriend and he is living in your home and in your space and you don't really have any way to avoid him. I sense that your mother wants you to like him so that she can justify the relationship and him living in your home. I suggest that you don't want him in the home and so not speaking to him is your way of communicating that to him (and your mother). Unfortunately I am not a counselor so I can't necessarily give you advice on what you should do about this. But there are resources. If you trust your mother, you may want to open up to her and let her know how you feel about this man in your house and how you wish to have the freedom of movement in the house without having to respond to his demands (to talk, or whatever else he is expecting). Otherwise, you may be able to talk to your school counselor and find out if they have resources. Perhaps your mother has insurance and you can seek counseling, if you are uncomfortable telling your mother it is about the boyfriend, perhpas you can say because you all believe I have an issue because I don't talk, or feel I can speak.", "hash": "334cec04af36d9d8f48cfd11c7fe98983bc818d386ee61add17b3242300766c0"}

Eastern religions are big on meditation, centering and breathing techniques. It really works. The thing that helped me the most was to remember to breathe (but not too much). There was one time that I was hyperventilating without being aware of the fact. I thought that I was suffocating (not getting enough air) when I was, in fact getting too much air. My arms and legs went numb and fizzy. I felt faint and detached from reality. I thought that I was having a stroke or heart attack, which made it even worse. The anxiety became a panic attack. When I got to ER, they had me breathe into a brown paper bag. After about 10 minutes I was fine. Just being aware that that can happen, helped me to make sure that it wouldn't happen again. My breathing is the first thing that changes when I get anxious. I always have to be in tune with that. Breathe slow and deep, like a sigh. Tightness of the chest and heart palpitations can be another sign of anxiety. As long as I know what it is, I can usually diffuse it when it starts. Eat and drink right. Avoid sugar, tobacco, alcohol or other substances that may work against you and increase hyperactivity. The doctor prescribed mild medications to 'take the edge off' my anxiety. The same medication was also used to treat depression, which often goes hand-in-hand with anxiety. The meds were slow to build up in the body and slow to leave the body. It was important for me to take them as prescribed and not as needed. Taking then during a panic attack would not help as there was no 'instant relief' which might have made them habit-forming or addictive. After the initial evaluation, a treatment plan will be drawn up for your consideration. I would follow through with what the doctor suggests as they are the expert.

There are different classes of antidepressants and AFAIK they also work on anxiety. So far you have tried one class, SSRIs. There are also SNRIs, SARIs, Tricyclic, Tetracyclic, atypical, etc. Not all will be right for you but I want you to know there are more options out there. Also if you don't have depression buspirone is an anxiety only medication that may work for you. ZombieZ wrote: With all my ranting aside, what sort of side effects can I expect from coming off, will my anxiety be worse that it was before? I’d like to hear your experience with quitting medication. Ok, so I am not exactly med compliant and will routinely go off of my antidepressant if I think my depressive symptoms will stay away for a while. When I go off of it two things usually happen; I always get rebound anxiety during the withdrawal and I usually get headaches. I've discovered if I taper slow enough I can mostly avoid the headaches but the rebound anxiety is still there. My anxiety does seem worse initially, but that feeling eventually fades. Oh and a second argument for a slow taper is you increase your risk for brain zaps if you go too fast. They aren't harmful but they aren't fun either. When I'm off my antidepressant my anxiety rarely gets as bad as it was several years ago in college. This is because I have worked on it with my therapist and also because I removed certain things/people from my life that were making my anxiety worse. My guess is that even if you haven't done anything besides take an SSRI to help with your anxiety there is no reason to think it would be any worse than before you started it unless you have environmental triggers that have become worse over time. So yes you should be able to get off your SSRI without too much trouble but your anxiety could go back to where it was at before.

Three weeks after she came home, my bestfriend and his daughter died in a house fire. I would get these episodes off and on all day, heart rate at times would be well over 150.

It is the barometer that I use for determining my well-being and the onset of an anxiety or panic attack. That numbness and tingling is likely from hyperventilation (too much air) when it feels like you are suffocating (not enough air) and having a stroke or heart attack. This can feed into full-blown panic. I went through this before and now have to constantly monitor my breathing. I was on an anti-anxiety/antidepressant medication along with therapy for a few years that helped. I didn't even realize that depression was a part of it. I did self-medicate with alcohol, which worked great in the beginning (I had thought), but then it stopped working and actually made the anxiety worse. I did wear a heart monitor for 24 hours and kept a diary of my activities throughout the heart-rate test. I passed and and the tachycardia has not returned since, AFAIK. I have cut back on caffeine, sugar and salt/nitrates. No alcohol. 'Situational anxiety' feels unpleasant, but I have learned to deal with it.

Sorry for the rant, but i really don't know what to do any more.. When I was a kid I had such major anxiety that my mom took me out of school, and home schooled me. The only problem was that she was an in denial opiate addict who had no place doing so. I ended moving constantly due to her not being able to hold out a house or job and ended up teaching my self using the internet when it became an option. She has apparent mental health problems and threatened suicide multiple times to me as a child, barely came out of her room to make food so I very early developed the habit of poor eating, or not eating at all at times. Later, during my teenage years, I had basically raised my self and lived in a drug fueled haze, lots of opiates I had stolen from my mom, prescription stimulants I had convinced doctors to give me strong doses of, tons of weed, was on probation, constantly anxious, wondering where my next meal would come from or if I would have a roof over my head because of the constant fighting in my house and lack of care in that aspect. When I was 20 after lots of pain and self abuse and ignorance to a lot of it, I met a women who changed my life for ever. She taught me how to eat properly, how to cook for my self, the difference in local and organic foods, and many other small life skills I never even knew I was missing. She was a semi recovering opiate addict, we got along great and found love in each other I don't think either of us really knew existed. Eventually we both got into psychedelics, they really changed my perspective and opened up my eyes to a lot of things in my life that I had not previously seen before, and helped me to make many drastic changes that I needed to start moving forward in my own life. She got off the opiates and got into college, I moved forward in a career path I had recently chosen, but picked up a extremely dependent hidden opiate addiction to mask the pain I had shoved away in fear of hurting my new found relationship that was going great in for the most part. Skip forward 3.5 years. We move from her/our/her dads/ condo to a bigger house, we get a dog, plan goes to $#%^ about 2 weeks after moving, move back to the condo with the dog, dogs crazy and doesn't do well in a small apt, all the stress of all of that and the stress is causes my relationship causes me to dive deep into the opiates which I had been trying to fight off for years unsuccessfully at this point, which in turn ruins my relationship....My anxiety if off the chain, I'm having panic attacks multiple times a day, can't eat for $#%^, can't sleep..It's awful. . Along with on and off opiate withdrawals and mood swing from the drug caused chemical imbalances which do not help at all either.. So around November of last year I move back in with my mom who is now remarried as a last resort hoping that I might be able to use it as an opportunity to get my $#%^ together. Because of how desolate the area where she lived was I was able to get away from the opiates and only have went back twice since then but never actually relapsed which i'm insanely proud of my self for. My life perspective Is so different now, I don't even feel like the same person I was back then. I am much more thoughtful, and have made lots of progress in many ways and greatly respect my self for that. During this time, the emotional abuse from her has been extremely taxing though and as a now much more conscious adult I really see the extent to which it is/was... Constantly I am reminded of times during my childhood that were extremely difficult for me, am belittled for not having previously made good choices that would have ended up with me not having to stay with her, calling me names, being told that no wonder my ex left me, etc, etc, etc, Even though I am trying to be an adult and talk our problems out, but am met with hand gestures, lots of what evers, yelling, passive aggressiveness and narcissistic abuse, and am left feeling so hurt disgusted, and angry that often I will end up yelling at her, and even at other people sometimes if they catch me in a bad moment, and this has caused major problems for me at work and in my once flourishing social life recently....I would just leave and be homeless and go figure it out of my own, but I need to think about my dogs well being as well as my own now... During of the emotional struggle from all of this, I have lost a lot of weight that I had gained after quitting the drugs, can't sleep for $#%^, am worn down emotionally and physically, smoking way too many cigarettes, angry, emotional, depressed, and overly tired during the day, and keep thinking it's almost a better idea to just start doing the opiates again and then i'll at least be able to put on that mask to avoid how I'm feeling right now... I really don't want to do that though, and am getting very afraid that i'm not going to get out of this situation in a healthy way... Any kind advice would be very helpful. Or just a empathic reply of some sort.. Please help.

They seemed to work at first, but did eventually turn against me. Drinking used to relax me, weed just made me paranoid (which I confused as a high). I was able to manage my stress levels then. The building anxiety could break into panic attacks. I had no idea where they came from. I placed my life and the lives of others in danger when they consumed me. Asking for help was difficult for me. I felt that I could solve my 'personal' problems, but it kept lapsing back into the same old, same old. Asking for help takes great courage. It is a sign of strength, not a sign of weakness. I was licked. My problem was too big for me alone against it. I was able to enter detox, rehab and aftercare. The doctors gave me anti-depressants, which also worked as anti-anxiety. I was able to work and function again as I became more stable. The doctors could do nothing for me until the drugs and alcohol were removed from my system. Only then, could prescribed medications and therapy work. If you haven't already, I would go for a thorough physical exam and bloodwork with your primary physician. Rule out any chemical/endocrine imbalances, hormonal, etc (which can be treated) first. Have them write a referral to a specialist for a further evaluation with other issues as necessary.

I wanted to share my own experience and what I’m about to write is the worst regret of my life and I’m starting to feel really anxious, suicidal and depressed as a result. I'm 27 years old now so this happened 10 + years ago I myself had my own embarrassing and shameful experience when I was a very young teen with my younger brother too (both males, approx. 5 yrs apart). As kids we would play with each other all the time like we were attached at the hip. Despite the fighting, we’d love each other’s company. Long story short we were wrestling or playing around one day and somehow I ended up starting this game where I dry humped/rubbed my body against his in somewhat of a sexual way, plus a little touching/groping. What worries me is that I was the one who initiated it. He did consent but was probably too young to understand what was going on. It only happened once or twice and then the urges went away and only after it happened is when I started to realize it was awkward. We're both straight and never been attracted to the same sex but for some reason this happened. The last time it happened he got a little bothered by it so that made me realize that I should stop. Ever since then I've been regretting it so much and feel really depressed about the situation. Over the years its been coming back slowly to haunt me more and more. Nothing but shame, regret and disgust. Sometimes suicidal thoughts come to me as well. I hate myself so much for it and for while I convinced myself that I was some sort of monster that sexually abused his brother. I’ve been a good person my whole life to everyone I know and I always treat people with the most empathy and sympathy. This once incident is the one thing where I wish I had done different. I honestly don't know what prompted me to do this but at that age I probably wanted to know what being sexual/having sex felt like due to puberty and hormones, yet I was never sexually attracted to my brother. I wasn't even watching porn or masturbating at that age yet and I didn't even know what masturbating was (very socially underdeveloped and sheltered at that age). I'm guessing serious urges through puberty, experimentation, curiosity and lack of control of hormones. My brother and I were very close, and always around each other playing physically so that might have also led to doing it with him rather then anyone else. Now, I don't remember physically forcing him or threatening him in any way and there was no malicious intent behind it but I get these “what if” thoughts that I maybe might persuaded him in a playful way but even that is a very vague fuzzy memory which worries me. Looking back at it I wish I never did it but at the time I guess wasn’t able to fully understand the “rights” and “wrongs” of sexuality and the potential consequences. Now I've heard this kind of stuff is somewhat common amongst siblings at a very young age but I'm a little concerned and worried because technically I was not a 'child' anymore. I could have technically been considered a young 'teenager' at the age (can't remember due to how long ago it was). I think I was maybe 14-15yrs of age. My therapist said that this stuff is somewhat common and that although I wasn't a child, mentally and cognitively I was still acting as a kid. Also, because my parents were extremely overprotective, sheltering and neglecting that that could have been another factor in my delayed development. I also rarely had friends and I was very attached to my brother which could have brought us closer to age in terms of development. The regret is absolutely terrible and it feels like a completely different person that has done this when I was that age. I’ve never molested, sexually abused, harassed or touched any child or even had the thought of doing such things for that manner. My questions are: 1) Is this considered abuse or experimentation ? 2) Should I bring it up with my brother to apologize and to see if I can help him if he is negatively affected by it ? Or will that do more harm then good ? Thanks in advance for any insight you guys might have. I appreciate it !", "hash": "3d52d842de4de907eb89c5faf33ccd0f7250d9e0889f39b68a265b924411f47d"}

I have lived with depression for as long as I can remember but it was only a few years ago that I started going to therapy. I tried group therapy and one-on-one therapy, but none seemed to really help. I switched therapists but they didn’t help either. Now I have a new therapist and was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. However, I feel like these don’t begin to tackle the things I’ve been experiencing. I don’t know if I’m doing the right thing or if I even have a problem to begin with. I worry all the time that I’m just making things up. Maybe my problems aren’t as big as they seem. I feel empty most of the time. I can’t bring myself to feel good things or even bad things sometimes, it just feels like nothing’s there. If it’s not emptiness, it’s sadness..I go through life detached and feel as if though I’m looking at everything through a TV screen or as if though I’m in a “first-person” [point of view] game. Recently though...I’ve been feeling a little different. There are days where my hands start shaking and I can’t sit still. My throat starts to close up and when I feel that I’m choking I start to panic. My therapist has now diagnosed me with a panic disorder along with the depression and anxiety. Along with that my anxiety has been getting worse. At times I feel so unstable. I feel like I can’t take it, like if everything’s too much and my head starts racing. During these times, I start hyper-focusing on sounds and feelings. They become so overwhelming that they trigger panic attacks. I’ve lived with depression and anxiety for so long that I learned to work around it. I thought that if I could just keep folowing the routine of life (wake up, shower, work/study, eat, sleep) that I could be ok and continue to “live” (not be a burden to others and not turn to worse coping methods). I was wrong though. I find that the more time I live like this the more unstable I get. Lately I have started seeing things. I see spiders crawling on the floor, on other furniture, and on me. I even feel them sometimes. All of this makes my anxiety and instability get worse, I don’t know what to do about it. My therapist strongly feels that I need medication but a part of me can’t go through with it. I feel like my problems aren’t big enough to take medication. I was always yelled at and scolded for being sad. I was always told that there was nothing wrong with me and that others have it far worse, that I simply need will power to feel better.. I know I have problems, but I can’t help but feel that they aren’t worth enough to go as far as medication. They are nothing compared to others and maybe I’m just putting too much attention to small matters. I don’t know how to measure the weight of my problems and don’t know how to convince myself that going through with medication is a good thing that can help me..I feel very lost.

True, they are experts and they are probably suggesting medication for a reason. My therapist says that too, that there are options with medication and if it doesn’t work I can stop them. It’s a good point and does ease some of my worries, but I just can’t shake the feeling that my problems aren’t “big enough” to get medication. However. Today has made me feel tired and defeated. I ended up having a conversation with my sister about the topic of depression. I never really talked about it with her, but even she repeated the same thing the rest of my family says: you just need more will power to get over it, others have it worse than you. Hearing that again made me go into another wave of depression and anxiety. I wondered why my family wasn’t accepting that mental health is a real issue. I wondered why even though I have asked them to help me and try to understand, at least inform themselves about mental health, they continue to ignore me. It’s been this way for so long, I feel that they have abandoned me in a way. Maybe I’m being childish about this? I know that I’m old enough to take care of myself, but I simply want their support. They’re my family...Anyway. I felt like something in me is done. I looked for a psychiatrist earlier today. I feel like I’m unstable for most of the week now, it’s hard. I hope trying medication will help. Of course, I will still work closely with my therapist.

Can you imagine how much better life might be if you could simply 'take the edge off' of depression and anxiety that may be holding you back more than you think it is? Finding the right med and the right dosage might take some adjustments. The doctor will monitor you to see how they are working, or not. Be patient.

When i try to choose what i like, she puts me off and starts to emotionally abuse me whenever she gets the chance so that i will regret not doing what she wants me to do.

I started working as a freelancer artist and i make some good money every weekend, i get to buy myself whatever i want online like make up, clothes...etc but she starts telling me how ugly they look on me and that i should only wear a long black gown. Now the thing is, im planning to lie to her and tell her that my classes will start at 3 on tuesdays (it actually starts at 6) but i want to lie so that i will be able to go to the mall next to my university alone .... but again, im afraid that a relative of mine will see me and will tell her and that's gonna put me in trouble.

I like to think of drugs as a way to expand my consciousness. I consider myself intelligent and I am very curious about our world, especially regarding how we perceive our realities and what reality actually is. We only live once, you know? I have never used drugs as an escape, just out of curiosity, and I don't drink or smoke cigarettes, at all. I'm not depressed, I don't cry, or have anger issues. My mind is always questioning, processing, and trying to see every single angle of things. I'm just this way- I'm a calm analyzer who likes to figure out how, and most importantly- why? However, this curiosity got the best of me last year when I had the chance to try LSD for the first time with my boyfriend. I have dabbled in MDMA and cocaine, and smoked marijuana regularly, so I was absolutely no stranger to drugs and the effects. I am not sure that it was actually LSD though- because of how horrifyingly long it lasted. The trip also felt \"dirty\"- a lot of how the trip felt did not sound or feel \"right\". I can go deeper into this if you wish, but I'm pretty positive that it was not actual LSD. We took way too much due to the time it took to set in, and boy do I regret it. The trip was so intense that I suffered ego death. I'm sure that this is why I have such severe anxiety now- I thought I was going to die during the trip, which is ridiculous, because I've done COCAINE which is much more dangerous than LSD and suffered NO anxiety and kept a rational mind. Tripping will do that to you. At the most intense point of climbing up, I kept screaming in my mind all of these things... Imagine a spinning galaxy, this is what I saw through my mind's eye. I literally could not keep my eyes open due to how intense it was. My body was in tremors for hours due to a very intense anxiety attack that would not end but my mind was so far gone that it turned into pure fear. Being the trooper I am, I just soldiered through it. Spinning and spinning and darkness, just my voice screaming and echoing, inside my own head. It was so vast and amazing and full but full of terror. At the point I last remember (before the trip started to decrease in intensity) I made peace with my deceased mother and was screaming in my head that I love everybody and forgive them for everything. I'm glad that this happened, because I don't hurt over her anymore. I began to let myself go at that point, accepting my death, but not fully before the trip started to decrease. I think that if it kept going a bit longer at that intensity, I would have fully allowed myself to let go and the fear would have been conquered. It didn't work that way though. Even typing this is making my hands and face tingle with anxiety... even though I logically and rationally know it's over, and I should get over this already. Now, I have anxiety and derealization. I don't have depersonalization- my personality and bodily sensatations have remained pretty much intact. Functioning has become a task, though. I have anxiety about DYING!!! If my heart palpitates, which is out of anxiety, my mind immediately snaps to the thought that I'm DYING, time to PANIC! I logically accept that we will all die someday, there is no god (sorry- belief in god won't help me... I'm way too hippie to ever believe anything like that) and we're all a part of the natural way of things. However, the fear still grips me. This is my main issue. I'm becoming a bit depressed because of how my reality feels now and the thought that it will always be this way. Normal life seems so much harder because it feels like my external world has been turned inside out, and now I'm living from inside my head to the outside... if that makes sense. It's very frustrating. I also have very paranoid ideations- that my boyfriend is cheating on me- i.e., he's at work, or when he doesn't text me back right away, my mind immediately jumps to thinking horrible things and it begins the cycle of obsessive paranoid thoughts. I can psyche myself out of these, but that sinking feeling usually remains until I completely distract myself. I've never been like this before, and I KNOW he is not doing anything to hurt me- he does not have the capacity to. It's all in my head and it all began after the trip. On the other hand, I have a lot of childhood trauma that I THOUGHT I had dealt with- with the years of therapy and all. I don't remember much of my childhood. I'm sure it's all buried in there and I have no interest to dig it up... really. I feel scared and see no point to it, what is the past is the past. I saw this today: \"As far as the cause of your distress; At worst it may have unlocked some buried emotional/psychological crap that has to percolate out\" and it really comforted me- and for 5 seconds, the first time in nearly a year, I felt a break into reality. However, it's gone now. I can't afford therapy quite yet- but have any of you had a similar experience? Any advice, or coping skills?

I've experimented in my time too. But mine is due to lots of stress and past issues of when I was a child. So going to a therapist has also helped me. However there are other things you can do: There are lots of POSITIVE things you can do: A nurse practioner has told me and I researched my self online that when you do aerobic type excercise like walking fast or a jog or joining a aerobic type class at a gym or some sort of dance form for 15-30 minutes will lower your cortisol levels which will then allow you to have more seratonin to your brain. It gives you the same calming effect as taking a benzo type medication minus all the negative side effects that those evil meds can give you. And it lasts for about 6 hours. And if you continusly do excercise at least 4-5 times a week. You will build steady cortisol levels and be able to be free and live again and be unstoppable You have to be brave, courageous- use positive affirmation daily, post them around your home in your car. Positive talk your self that you are well, healthy, calm at peace, trusting and everything will be ok. I do aerobic excercise 4-5 times a week and do yoga twice a week. Yoga also helps ALOT. It helps you stop thinking about worrys and fears and just have that hour to think of nothing but your breathing and being at peace. So anytime I'm feeling anxious I go for a run for 10-25min then come back home and put on a relaxing yoga song that plays for 7 minutes and do deep breathing (breathing in all positive thoughts and exhaling and letting go of all negative thoughts.) Also take magnesium its suppose to be caliming and a B Complex vitamin with folic acid (B3, B6, inositol, folic acid.) I also hear passion flower ( natural herb)tincture drops - 3 drops- 20 drops- everyone's body is different so I would take 3 drops with water and see how you feel and take 5 more drops if that isnt doing anything. Chammomile is soothing also. Also try aromatherapy. Cinnamon candles, lavender bath etc. Massages are great. Try accupuncture too. AND STAY AWAY FROM Weed- that will just make you even more anxious. Once in awhile having a glass or 2 of wine at night is relaxing and soothing. Not sure from what part of the area your from but in the US there are qualified therapists that can help you if you are low income. I think its like any where from 10-30 per session. Also read the book, \"The Secret\". It has a lot of positive type thinking and how to manifest more positive to you. And lastly but definitely not the least its actually number one for me is I have GOD in my life and he guides me and is always there for me helping me through this.", "hash": "32ac9552933ec6608d5d533bc4dd29624ef14ce7da9c4a67b02f9d22d5a7201c"}

LSD mimics serotonin and links into the same pathways in the brain. My own experiances were much like yours. They lasted way too long, were not enjoyable and changed my perception. After much reading and inner searching I realized that my experimenting was my quiet way of trying to 'fix' myself. That wasn't the solution. I recall that feeling of disassociation for months after. I felt as if I'd been re-wired and spent a lot of time over-analyzing everything. I felt like I was missing some basic, all encomposing answer to everything. The best way for me to describe the feeling was 'I ghosted' through that time. I had lost substance. Thankfully, time, knowledge, a good doctor, friends and family have given me substance again. Oh ya, there's nothing like long walks in nature to help 'ground' yourself. I've begun waking up early to watch the sunrise. I find it inspiring and soothing. Then I go back to bed.

I was the highest I have ever been off weed in my life except I was left alone in my house for about 6 hours and I totally lost it and started questioning reality and my own sanity. Anyway the next day when I woke up I still felt out of this world like i have been given new eyes or some $#%^ like that. soooo after that my anxiety kicked in more I started to think I was totally loosing my mind i went back to alcohol and THEN i started to use oxycodone. after drinking and feeling more depressed and detached I was looking for anything besides SSRI to help me so I turned to opiates. Now 6 months down the road I have a drug addiction to opiates but everytime I use one unless i use it real heavy i feel so much relief from dp that I almost feel normal again. so yea I would have to say your anxiety is caused from the drugs.

Most LSD you find on the street now are European research chemicals being sold as LSD, and often times those that are selling it use imprecise dosing.

I sense of fear like BIG fear came over me and I told everybody in the room \" something isn't right \" then my eyes started going back and fourth really fast from side to side about like 2 times I think ...

So after I couple days I couldn't sleep alone I slept with my mom everything was so different , I was so scared I thought that like the devil was after me I thought I wa shearing voices at one point. Every time I would close my eyes in the dark I would make out scary images . Then eventually I developed a anexity disorder and panic disorder and I'm convinced I have PTSD . My panic attacks are about that I died that night and I am in hell and I'm going to keep going through what I went through that night because that is my hell . Like I said before I blacked out so it convinces me that I might have died . Plus everything seemed so dream like to me felt like I was in a dream everything looked unreal . So eventually I got over the hearing the voices and not being able to sleep alone or sleep in the dark . Where I'm at is with my panic attacks and anexity I can't even get in a car or anything I pretty much just stay home I can't live my life I live in fear. I have heart palpitations from all this and a high heart rate . I won't take any other medication because I'm traumatized that I will have a bad trip . I will physc myself out into having a panic attack on the medication . I don't have any fiends because all the people I used to hangout with were the people I did all the bad stuff with and partied with . I completely changed I don't drink I don't smoke or anything anymore I just sit in my house all the damn time . I feel like I need help I have bad depression from all this because I don't wanna live like this it's sad and scary I wouldn't wish this upon anybody . I also have some hate for myself because I did this to myself . I just don't know what to do I can't live myself and there's so many things I want to do in life ... Nobody understands my mom things I just over react she gets mad that I miss my dentist appointments and extc all because of my anexity I'm scared to have an anexity attack or panic attack while I'm out. I just have so many problems now I don't know what to do I want friends that know what I go through or go through similar things as me so we can get through it together.. Be there for each other and extc I don't wanna feel so alone. Certain things freak me out to like loud noises or if I hear a noise and can't figure out what it is I HAVE to find out or I'll freak out. Fast forwarding stuff freaks me out the ceilings fans that move fast freak me out , seeing people in fear or freak out makes me freak out. I have all these new problems that I never had before .. I have a little bit of OCD, i get panicky when my mom doesn't answer her phone and I don't know where she's at I'll freak myself and think the worst . I over think EVERYTHING and always end up freaking myself out which leads me to a panic attack . $#%^ is just crazy now I can't live like this I don't know what to do I need friends I need someone there for me who knows ... Idk what to do ....", "hash": "2bf5818322c36aa7dc99f69a11df46ab25edb3f836356438ae0e88c0fb2e5417"}

Your subconsciousness is most alert to things that are wrong when you first wake up. In your case for some reason it has decided that you are not safe. Its an error, but thats what it believes and it wants you to know it which is why you feel something bad is about to happen to you. Your body can only maintain this heightened level of alertness you feel for at about 40 minutes. After that it will fade.

When I was a kid I was exposed constantly to family dramas and fights between my parents, sometimes violent. Growing up I developed a strong character, always calm and honest with myself, a strong physical constitution. Thanks to this I've always been healthy and fully recovered from 2 car crashes, 3 neck vertebrae disks fractures, internal throat bleeding due to glass splinter in food losing 1.3 liter of blood, multiple head physical traumas from childhood, almost losing a testicle when little falling from a tree, bipolar episodes 3 years ago when my father died and more. For the past 4 months or so up until now, I feel like something's wrong inside. At start I thought it was something casual as always, but it doesn't go away. Especially when I try to fall asleep, I can feel muscle spasms a lot more and sometimes I wake up due to my own body jerking, shaking the whole bed, waking up scared. Also when in bed sometimes I feel like my heart stops beating and I'm about to pass out, and that's where anxiety starts eating me. I'm saving money for a full blood check-up which is really expensive where I live. I also live alone and have to pay for a lot of things and saving money isn't easy, not on the best of terms with family so asking them for help is not an option. My mother says it's all in my head and that I should switch to a healthier lifestyle and I'll feel better but I know it's more than that. I've never felt this way, even in the worst conditions I've ever been in the past, this is different. I smoke a pack of cigarettes daily, drink lots of beer during weekends with friends which is actually the only time I'm not anxious. I don't do drugs, I also have a pretty chaotic sleep pattern and I workout 4 times a week. I'm starting to be scared, afraid and feeling weak. I don't feel like myself anymore.

I am a new member (not a native English speaker, hopefully this won't be a problem) and I've never resorted to mental health forums or support groups before. I find myself in a situation that I am now unable to deal with and for which I am not able to find a name yet, which is what brings me here today. I need to gain understanding about my problem if I want to fix it, and I think I should start understanding whether this is an actual issue at all and acquire tools to describe it properly. I am not sure if this is the correct section but I do believe my problems are anxiety-related and I am open to further clarifications. I will try to explain what I'm dealing with as clearly as possible and eventually add background information if necessary. I am a 27 year old woman and during the last few months I have been experiencing unpleasant and almost unbearable physical sensations, accompanied by a great deal of related anxiety. These symptoms have been profoundly affecting my lifestyle, my productivity and my peace of mind. I haven't found a clear definition for my combination of symptoms so I will try and list them as carefully as possible: - Troubles with sleeping (this started around 4 years ago and has been worsening in time). Examples of this could be: at first I would prefer to arrange my sheets/duvet/pillows in a certain manner. I would sometimes remove my sheets to avoid crinkles. I would spend a significant amount of time moving the bed/adjusting bedding in order to feel more \"comfortable\". This would happen with virtually any combination of sheets, pillows, mattresses etc. (So I wasn't using anything that was actually uncomfortable). I would sometimes question hosts and friends about how comfortable they found my bed to be and would always receive positive comments, such as that the mattress was soft and comfy. Then I would experience discomfort while sleeping in beds different from my own (such as when going on vacation, sleeping at friend's house...) to the point that I would complain about not being able to get some good sleep in other people's beds. This has eventually led to an anticipatory fear of going on vacation, etc., due to being uncomfortable in bed, and in a feeling of shame in showing other people how I arrange my bed, how much time I spend adjusting it, and how much I toss and turn at night. I have noticed a ritualistical fashion in those behaviors. - Fidgeting in clothes: this has been worsening during the very last few months, and seems to have build up in time. At first I would find myself avoiding particular garments that weren't particulary comfortable; I am now in a place where I can only wear the same thing all the time, clothes have to fit certain standards for me to even consider buying them. I have given up on wearing garments that I never had problems with and that I didn't want to give up on, such bras and tights, which causes a lot of embarassment and discomfort. In winter I tend to be too cold because I cannot wear thick thights; in summer I have to wear oversized clothing to conceal the fact that I'm not wearing a bra. I don't attempt to buy underwear anymore because I have spent a lot of money on it and nothing would fit comfortably. I found some comfortable underwear a couple of years ago and have managed to keep that till now, but that will soon wear out and I don't know what I'll wear after that. I have come to the point of only having 2 night shirts that I could sleep on, I even have to try on socks before deciding if I can wear them, and I feel a lot of discomfort and find myself fidgeting in clothes when I am outside. Virtually nothing seems to fit comfortably. - Related anxiety: I do have anxiety both unrelated to these issues and anticipatory/subsequential anxiety. When I am supposed to go out, I experience anticipatory anxiety because I know my clothes might not fit comfortably and I spend a lot of time and energy planning what to wear so that that doesn't happen, or at least to alleviate those feelings. I sometimes avoid going out or have breakdowns after going out because of those unpleasant sensations. I find myself struggling to do things that other people can do naturally - such as sleeping, running errands, going on vacation. I find myself clenching my teeth and developing exhausting headaches in results of these activities, or having breakdowns when I've got to perform such activities. I strongly believe this is a psychological issue because I haven't always had it (it seems to build up and worsen in time) and because when I am in a very good place mentally, my symptoms improve dramatically. I want to become a better person and be a functional part of this society. I used to work in cancer research in university and would love to keep my work up but the burden of everyday life seems to weigh me down. I am certain this is anxiety driven and I would love to get a job so that I can afford therapy and learn more about myself and this \"condition\".", "hash": "303f24342c0d48449493d8e5c22fcba8283b2adbcbe34e17e20ba8fc9d4ef346"}

This isn't the busiest section of the forum so I'm sorry no-one has replied to you sooner. You have done well to reach out for help here. Firstly, the symptoms you describe are not normal, they are impeding your daily functioning and are bothering you, so regardless of the cause, they are certainly a problem for you. It is good that you can recognise that your symptoms dramatically improve when you are in a good place mentally. You are right that this gives a big clue that your symptoms are psychological. The other thing that made me think that your symptoms might be psychological was this: as I read through what you have written you say that you have hit rock bottom, that you are unable to deal with it and you describe it as a problem and wanting to address it but then you conflict against yourself and say that you are not sure that it is an actual issue at all. This kind of conflicted thinking is often a sign that a problem is psychological, you are caught between being motivated to change and being motivated to ignore it (because these kind of symptoms usually have a deeper background that is really challenging to deal with). Your actual symptoms reminded me a bit of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD).You have something you are constantly thinking (obsessing) about: are you going to be comfortable and what can you do to make yourself comfortable. And you have a compulsion (action that you have to carry out): to readjust the bed or to only put on certain comfortable clothing. Your symptoms might fit other psychological problems, only a professional can give you a diagnosis and help you down that road. Have you considered seeking out a professional to help you with these problems? In a way, I am not defined by my dissociation. In a way, I am. FORMER admin moderator.

Yes I have considered seeking professional help, what has been mostly holding me back is that I don't know the cause of my symptoms and whether they have a psychological or physical origin. It is also hard to describe my symptoms and I haven't had much luck reading about them online. The first time you come across something it might be hard to describe it properly as you do not possess proper tools to adress the issue. It is not as easy as learning about the symptoms of conditions like depression or anxiety since I have not read about similar symptoms often online (apart from people who apprently suffer from sensory processing conditions). I have, surprisingly enough, found other people referring to similar symptoms on a social anxiety board, but I do not feel like I suffer from social anxiety and I don't think that gives me more insight on what I'm going through. My main concern is that therapy is quite expensive and I would need to open up about this with my family. It is already hard enough to explain my situation to my closest friends as they \"question\" me about the causes of my anxiety and don't seem to get it.", "hash": "3f40a10d62d6c34f8a8464b1347b104eba1530940440448a245158b5e7c6f9e8"}

The reason I registered is because I saw a post from someone else that really reminded me of an issue I am currently dealing with but with a different reason. I've always been the kind of person that would ask \"what if\" at an extremely early age to now because of fear of the unknown. I never realized it as an issue until my fourth grade year when my anxiety started to show itself in the ugliest way. No one knew what was wrong with me and I didn't know what was wrong with me. I never knew mental illness was a thing. Through the years, I've developed irrational fears stemming from the anxiety. I was professionally diagnosed in November of 2013. Nothing was done to help. The whole goal of everyone around me was to keep me off of medication but now I think it's ruining my life. The constant fear, paranoia, and high vigilance I have throughout the day being alone is exhausting and every sound of situation in my mind feeds it all. I can't stop looking over my shoulder, feeling like someone or something is always there. I cannot think back to any trauma and neither can my family. I've just always been scared. Scared of people and things I don't understand. The intrusive thoughts about absolutely terrifying things that can and WILL happen to me in my lifetime playing over and over and over again in my mind before bed strains my sleep thin and I dread going to sleep at night.And they're not thoughts like my day time thoughts which are to lock all the doors and windows and draw my blinds and board up my bedroom door to sit in here all day - they're thoughts about my life and what is to come and what I'll be dealing with until the day I pass. I have panic attack after panic attack and it exhausts me to sleep and that's no way to live for me. I constantly go to the doctor to get help where no help is given. Recently, I've had to go in because of my heart fluttering randomly and near-fainting and I know for a fact it's because of the anxiety. It's slowly eating away at my life and my doctor wants to keep me off of anti-anxiety medications for fear I'll gain more weight. I've exhausted all other ways to cope with it that are healthy and wont damage my life or well-being and I'm left with the only option being medication. But all of this has left me with the question... How? How do I cope with this? How can I sleep? How can I calm my mind? How can I stop looking over my shoulder? I fear that I'm asking too much of my doctor asking for him to see me for symptoms because he cannot fix what I have. He can't take away the anxiety or the depression but the symptoms are becoming too much. Should I just go and be honest? I feel like our meetings are so strained and like I'm being timed every single second I am there. I'm far too poor to keep going or to get a therapist.", "hash": "e8948467e646e216083c1a7c2d24b2775f12a4d9cbf9809632e43e949bbe25f4"}

I wrote my story down first because I been wanting express EVERYTHING that I believe has caused this SAD while retaining my anonymity and the COMPLETE truth of my feelings and situations I've been in. Sorry for the long response, I rambled and vented quite a bit of stuff that was pent up, so I just wrote it all out without stopping.:roll Read what you want, but my direct topic is the last 2 underlined paragraphs How my SAD started/Introduction.... Ever since my friend/teammate was shot and killed in October I had begun smoking ALOT of weed thinking I was subconsciously fine but it was a very poor coping mechanism. Was also dodging deans at my school and police outside because I was selling snacks and marijuana edibles to put money into my (and my mother's) VERY poor pockets. (Got caught up with it previously in school but continued under the radar despite being ). Next, I was helping my friend find his sweater which had stolen in a brawl between 2 different parties (one party known, from my school, and the other unknown) in the store we were in. While outside, we see 2 of the unknown guys who were in the fight follow my other friends who walk off and we follow and then suddenly the 2 guys disappear. They (unknown party from brawl) reappear with 8-10 other people coming down to us and attempt to rob us of our phones. We refuse and 2 of them jump one of my other friends. I jump in to fight them to save my friend and I get hit with a blunt object but I'm okay. They run off and leave They stole my some of stuff while fighting, my friends coat and his money and my other friends sweater. I later hear from a bystander that they had seen the unknown men tuck away a gun after telling their acquaintances not to shoot (it sounds unbelievable but stuff like this happens in NYC all the time.) I smoked after that as well too. I started to have mini panic attacks for a while while I was high and I decided to stop smoking cold turkey in a month. Trying to change from habitually smoking to socially or barely at all. But since then I've been alot more depressed and anxious, not only fearing for my safety but also always feeling judged. I think it may have been because in my depressive state I stopped taking care of my hygiene as much as I would usually and it may have caused my clothes to smell because of how blazed I was 4/7 days out of the week(before, during and afterschool) and my overall laziness while high. Alot of problems devloped with my mom as well. I was coming home at nearly 11pm everyday. Subsequently leading to me being locked out one day on a school night and lots and screaming matches. One day specifically, my anxiety was so bad I honestly thought I had $#%^ on myself because I constantly smelled $#%^ somewhere always near me ( I dropped my the bottom of my bag in some dog $#%^ while I was high and it wasnt washed immediately afterwards, found out because my mom took my bag and washed it while afterwards telling me it smelled lol...still didnt ease my stress) and I was incredibly embarrassed about it. So I was problrably talked about all day and I didnt know until 7th period when everyone said it smelled like $#%^. I didnt know it was my bag while I was tweaking out and having an anxiety attack already because my teacher was talking about drugs and it perked my ears up to wondering if she was talking about me being high. So that anxiety probably didnt help me look/ act normal. Ever since then I've upset and self conscious because I basically feel like a walking piece of glass and all my insecurities can be seen . Not feeling safe having to watch my back and also smelling bad specifically. I know its dumb but I always get anxious when someone scratches, sniffles or covers their nose. Also if someone stares at me for too long, walks behind me slow (what I feel like is too slow) and having their hands in their pockets for a long time, I get paranoid. I used to constantly ask my mom and sister if I smell bad but they would always just say no and eventually get upset and tell me to stop. Also used to be very conscious about smelling when I had weed on me too, always trying to cover it up to avoid detection So this might be a way that my brain/karma is kicking my ass for my stupidity. Oh and also my absent father who I haven't heard from in 9 years is trying to come back into my life as well.:frown2: (No, I'm not a gang member, no I don't continue in illegal distribution of such products, yes I do live in the hood) Me Currently.... Started medication, adderrall which helps my ADHD and depressive laziness and antidepressants for the anxiety and depression as well. I have been scared to go to school, go outside, and really live my life. Anxious about everything; smelling bad, if I'm being judged about how I dress, if someone is watching me or plotting on me and about fake friends. In my extended loneliness I've had of time to review how they acted and treated me and how naive I was to trust them(These feelings have extended to family as well, I've had many epiphanies about the duplicitous actions of the assholes in my life). Now I stick to making artwork(which helps me while home), listening to music and binge watching tv shows. Been feeling pretty pathetic. My mom has been understanding mostly but her outbursts of frustration when I have my emotional fits of depression include her yelling \"Your life is not as hard as you make it seem! You don't see me taking a pill for whenever I dont feel good!\", which just makes me feel like an even bigger burden. Yesterday I ate an edible early and locked myself in the room while I \"took a nap\" AKA silently crying for an hour and then going to sleep. But I've been looking for a job in spite of it but the constant rejection keeps reinforcing my negative thought process.:crying: The Topic/My Solution... In my pathetic times of binge-watching I have likened a character from Power, Ghost aka James St. Patrick. I have been watching this show for a month now and he is a character that embodies EVERYTHING I want to grow to be like. He is successful, a businessman (drug-dealer and nightclub owner; no I dont want to be a drug dealer anymore despite my past), father, confident, powerful, meticulous, intelligent, respected, fashionable, attractive, cunning, artful and overall an alpha male. Someone who demands and earns respect from those around him. I have been analyzing every part of his characteristics and I think that since I can't handle being the real me, I say to myself, \"how would Ghost act/respond in this ?\", then I tell myself to \"Be Ghost\" and I can feel my anxiety go away for a while as I let the \"Ghost\" that I have analyzed and created take control of my thoughts and mind. Its my coping mechanism that helps me but I would like to know if anyone else does this? does this seem like a bad idea even though its the only thing that works for right now? Am I \"crazy\" for this logic? or is as similar to the the stock phrase \"imagine the audience naked?\" Sorry for the long response, I rambled and vented quite a bit of stuff that was pent up, so I just wrote it all out without stopping.:roll Read what you want, but my direct topic is underlined above this sentence.

{"url": "https://www.psychforums.com:443/generalized-anxiety/topic207947.html", "text": "This made me really anxious by Fawnette » Wed Jul 18, 2018 9:56 am I am sometimes the anxious type who over-worries, overthinks things way too much, and I'm also oversensitive when I feel I have been wronged... but depending on the toughness or sensibilities of the other person, I also find myself unwilling to stick up for myself TOO much. Especially since I have found that I react way too badly sometimes when I'm upset, and when I know that I'm to blame partially for the situation, I know that anything I say might just dig me deeper than I was in the first place. So basically, back in May, I got super-excited about something... as I do sometimes. I have always been the type who gets WAY too excited about fandoms, particularly when I want to use them as an escape from reality (which probably is not healthy to begin with...) So I went searching for someone to commission to write a story I didn't have the motivation or energy to write myself. In my own way, I think I was also looking for new chat buddies, because all of my friends who I used to talk about fandoms with previously have become busy and less available, or they're not that interested in fandoms anymore. So I found someone who was taking commissions due to a family emergency, and I paid her forty dollars. She was clear upfront that when she could get to it would depend upon her muse, but that I wouldn't have to wait too long. In the end, she ended up refunding me after a week or two with a heartfelt apology, and I said I understood. And I did, especially since she was so polite about it. Then I turned to a friend of hers (with her blessing), and that's where the trouble started. To be fair, I DO have to say that a lot of this probably is my fault. When I get really excited about something, I sometimes start to develop certain expectations of a new person, especially since... as I indicated above, I have been pretty bored and lonely lately in the fandom departments, and I don't have much exciting going on in my life at times. So basically, I ran an idea by the new person, and she said she LOVED it. She also said she was going to be really busy, because she was working on a manuscript for professional publishing in July. So, just to be clear here, I paid her in May, and she said that it would take \"two weeks\", or possibly sometime in late June before she could really do anything on my commission. (I paid her seventy-five dollars; the previous person had been offering discounts due to the family emergency in the hopes of attracting more business more quickly.) Now... to be fair here, I had NEVER commissioned anyone to do any kind of writing before, so it is possible that I'm just not sure of the proper/standard etiquette, plus... I have seen independent individuals in the commission/crafting world tell others sometimes that 1: You can't rush art, and 2: that coming to them isn't the same as coming to a place in retail where everybody has a product available in two seconds. Plus... I think there were maybe some minor areas I got a little too friendly too fast, because I have sometimes felt (especially on the internet) that if someone seems nice, and we seem to be hitting it off, we're potential BFF material even if we're not. Also, it probably doesn't help matters any that I changed my mind four times, (I wanna go with this idea, no maybe I want to cancel now, no maybe I want to do this instead... no I'd like to go back to the original idea we started off with...) And I can definitely see how that would drive someone nuts, because sometimes I can be incredibly long-winded in my emails, and I've been told by other people before that sometimes I don't articulate very well when I get over-excited or anxious, leaving others to wonder WHAT I am trying to say, since a lot of my meaning sometimes gets lost in a lot of rambling. I have also driven others nuts sometimes due to my wishy-washyness, even my own family. And I'd have to say I acted wishy-washy in this case. In the end, (Again, bear in mind that I paid her in May, I was assured she would probably start the project in June, and I waited until mid-July to follow up much, when I heard nothing) so I finally demanded a couple of days ago for some kind of response, saying I either needed some kind of reply, since I did pay her, or I needed a refund. She then got kinda brash about it, saying that yes I did pay her, but I had broken every rule of etiquette and I did not respect personal space because I had sent her multiple emails, notes on Deviantart, and even posted on her profile wall once. And she also said that she had been upfront with me that she was busy, and simply said she wouldn't suffer any more pestering and that I should expect a refund by next Sunday, minus five dollars due to the pestering. Now... the thing is, I have pretty much decided to let the whole thing drop, because I pretty much consider it resolved now and if anything... I consider the entire matter to be a blessing in disguise, because it has shown me where I really DO need to start working on some of my own behavior. I even deactivated my Deviantart account and I backed off considerably from social media and fandom outlets, realizing that they are toxic to me and they make me very anxious... not to mention it's a bit too easy for me to get caught up in fandoms like a very unhealthy drug. But... I guess I have a bit too much of my mother in me, because there are still a few things that bug me about the entire matter. 1: On the person's own page, they said that they have a policy of trying to respond to any messages they receive within two business days, and if that is there policy, I didn't appreciate being ignored, especially since there were times when I WAS good at keeping my distance, and I didn't pester her at all during the month of July until I finally demanded a response, to which I got that catty response. 2: Since she had originally assured me that she would begin my commission sometime in June, she could've at least done me the courtesy of keeping me up to date, on her own, if there were going to be any delays. I got absolutely nothing but silence out of her until I got more aggressive and demanded an answer in mid-July. Honestly... I also feel that I should just let the entire matter slide and I probably did deserve her saying she would dock five dollars in a way, because I DID dump a lot of text on her in at least three emails in a row in May, and I did send her a few notes on DA and post on her profile wall once, and the poor woman probably felt bombarded, especially since she indicated she has mental issues and she has been very busy with a manuscript. To be fair, she might be anxious about pleasing her publisher, or maybe something even went wrong in the deal that disappointed her or she had to do rewrites, I don't know. I have a feeling I pressed the wrong buttons at the wrong time, which I am pretty good at doing since I can be a pest and sometimes I am not very tactful or considerate of other people's time. :/ I think in some ways... maybe I've also been getting a little too hyped up on my mom's attitude lately, and she's been adding to my ire in general, because she works in retail and it seems like any time we have any problems with people or them not acting fast enough or responding readily, she gets very, very angry and impatient, saying that if she responded so slowly or so badly in her line of work she'd be fired on the spot, and she's used to the idea that you are supposed to treat customers like royalty and she, in turn, excepts to be treated well whenever she's dealing with ANYONE in any kind of business venture. I can also hear her in my mind saying that if you commission someone, then that person should be treated like they are both the employee AND manager/boss of their own little business and should be treating/responding to \"customers\" accordingly... although I'm not entirely sure if it really works quite like retail when you are dealing with an independent writer on Deviantart who just does some writing on the side of a regular-based life/job or whatever.... So... I think I applied this mentality to this woman I commissioned, where I expected her to be my buddy, and maybe I expected her to be my friend and be willing to go over any text I sent her at the drop of a hat just because I had paid her, I don't know. When... I should have realized from the start that it was gonna be strictly professional, and I probably should have been more organized and decided what I was gonna do and what I wanted before I contacted her, and before I started bombarding her and changing my mind a lot. In the end, the entire episode left me anxious, left me overthinking and nitpicking to death about what I did wrong and what I feel she did wrong, and what everybody did wrong, and I even got upset over it a few times and even cried about it once or twice. I also feel like I've had some bratty entitlement issues over the entire thing, because... maybe I feel like I deserved her to be like my buddy and speak to me well, just because I paid her seventy-five dollars, even though she \"owed\" me nothing of the sort really. :/ In the end, I want to just forget that it happened. I pretty much cut ties with her and I'm just awaiting the refund, (money has always been a really sensitive issue for me anyway, particularly since I don't have THAT much to spare), and I have a feeling that if I say or do anything else at this point, it will probably just make everything worse, particularly since I think I expected too much too fast (INSTA-BUDDY!), not to mention I did bombard her a bit and I changed my mind about what i wanted or didn't want at least four times over the span of a month, which probably stressed her out and confused her on top of everything else she has to deal with right now. Just... I don't know. >.< If nothing else, it felt good just to organize my feelings on the matter and vent a little, I'm not sure what I'm looking for here or if this is even the appropriate forum/area to do this. I just know I learned one thing. I am never gonna do this again, since I've found I just really can't handle it and I come across as more of a disorganized pest than anything, and... I'm just not really gonna get involved in fandoms as much anymore, because I seem to develop very high expectations and it's almost like I want the writing equivalent of Burger King, have it done your way and have it done fast. :/ Not to mention I shouldn't be using fandoms as a substitute/escape from reality anyway, at least not religiously.", "hash": "b7418ea8f7ff68bcbe93fee253bce4646420b0b5b27cf3fefb0a221e9471d0d4"}

{"url": "https://www.psychforums.com:443/generalized-anxiety/topic207716.html", "text": "Please help, my days are ruined by questioning by Lilllirosebea » Tue Jul 10, 2018 8:25 am Hej, I'm 24 years old an posted a similar thread in the sexual category. I've had a couple of very nice responses there, but my mind is still going in circles...so I came here to see if this might be more anxiety driven obsessive behavior. A bit about myself: I am still a virgin, but had sexual encounters with the opposite sex on quite a few occasions and really enjoyed them when I did. I'm very indecisive and need a lot of approval from the outside world and do let my (mainly female friends) make decisions for me (also in terms of who I should/shouldn't date/ have sex with). They don't actively say that, but i always contemplate what would they think of me if I had sex with this guy... About a month and a half ago I visited a friend and was in quite a rut, I was unhappy for no real reasons (that only happend to me throughout this last year of my masters it was mainly due to my looks that I was very in confident in and my inability to make friends easily) and wondered why. Also meeting new people at her Erasmus made me nervous as I have social anxiety. When we came into the kitchen I got struck by the beauty of her female flatmates (long her, feminine dressing and bodies) and I though 'Oh my god, I must be gay'. From there on I panicked and started checking whether or not I am actually attracted to women or men (everyone I saw). I started going over my past encounters with men, questioning why I never went further with them and if that I didn't indicated I'm gay. I got stuck in my mind, encapsuled myself and went back home to my family where I cried myself to sleep every night. I have never felt so uncertain and I took every test that I could find on the Internet googleing how do i know if I'm gay? Of course when the answer was straight I felt relieve for some time, but then got back at it again. When the answer was gay or bi I lost it and started getting air shortage/ heart racing and panic attacks. It just doesn't feel right to me. (no offense here, I grew up in a very accepting surrounding, I have lesbian/gay friends and my parents are also okay with that) Ever since I am more aware of womens bodies when I am around them, always questioning am I attracted to that? It gives me a lot of anxiety and pain as I am by now not really able to tell what actually is attraction and what is just appreciation of a beautiful human or 'normal attention' given to the same sex. When I dream I usually dream about being with males, actually never a woman. When masturbating I think of a man being turned on by me and how I could turn him on best. (Is that weird in itself?) When I try to imagine being with a woman I feel either nothing or need to start burping which is usually my sign for 'nah not for me'. Thinking of men makes me happy, but nevertheless I am questioning the reality of my feelings as I was never good at pinpointing them down. When I'm with my friends I feel like of 'course your straight, no attraction whatsoever' again until anxiety hits me and I try to look for tension when we touch. But it's not a sexual 'zing', more an awareness of the other body that I feel and it is not nice. Romantically I definitley had crushes on boys, butterflies, heart racing, stomach drop, everything. When it comes to girls I head one really deep friendship whit a girl I admired I found her so cool (the way she dresse, was confident) and I am now questioning whether that was a crush or just me seeking a role-model? It was never sexual with her although we got changed in front of eachother and had a lot of sleep-overs/went on holiday togehter. Of course I thought 'oh she looks really good in that bra' but more in a sense of 'I wish my boobs were not as wonky and more like hers'. Now I'm questioning whether that was all or if my wanting to be like her/admiration ment more. It gives me anxiety spikes talking to her and I just want to be able to return to our normal friendship! With men I always dream about finding the man that make me laugh and I a am happy with and I had a couple of good friendships that turned into more, which is the point I backed out for various reasons (mostly me having lied about being a virgin, friends saying 'you really like HIM?' and me then questioning it) Although I want to be liked/ dress up for men I am shy when it comes to speaking to them and I can't seem to find the right words to make myself interesting to them which make me angry at myself. I can easily talk to girls and I used to think it's because there's 'nothing at stake' sexually. I am so confused! After spending most of my time on formus like this reading around coming out and anxiety stories, it's just enough...why can't I know what I feel? Yesterday I took a flexuality test that was recommended in this for mum, once I answered what I hope/believe to be true which came out with mostly straight and a tat of ambisexual. Then I took the test again answering all the questions with uncetain or the middle scale as I really don't know how I feel/can't determine what I feel and it popped up with mostly ambisexual, but still quite a lot of straight.

In the test it also indicated some sort of change in my sexuality which gave me another hit and I thought no that's not true, but started questioning it afterwards. It is true I don't feel as feminine at the moment, but that is due to a way to short haircut that gives me a lot of insecurities as I just want to be back to my normal girly seductive self. I am now constantly afraid someon ecould assume that I was a lesbian due to my haircut and I try to dress purposely female. That mostly females complimented me on my hair doesn't make it any better. I a pretty certain that I don't want to have a penis so I'm trying not to give too much attention to that part of the test. But does my not-so-feminie-feeling mean that I have to be attracted to girls? Am I aware of girls more because they radiate what I want back for myself? This morning I woke up still dreaming about being with a boy, I thought oh there it is you're straight and fell back asleep. When I woke up again my mind went 'Are you really'' and I started checking again, not knowing what the true answer is. I am so tired of this.

My father is mentally ill, abused me until I left when I was 18, physically and mentally. He has himself mental issues but was trying to persuade me it is me who need help. During 28 years of marriage, he had a part time job for 4 years, living from the social support and my mother´s money. My mother was neglecting me, later she told me it was because of my father´s breakdown and the fact that my brother was born ill (he is OK now). My brother is 5 years younger, 4 years after school living at my parent´s house, earns 250 dollars per month that he spends on expensive clothing and mobile phones. So all 3 of them are living mostly from my mother´s money. I do not live at home for 10 years now. I used to go home once in 6 weeks for a weekend, my mother pays for the ticket - like 50 dollars or so. They never forget to mention how much money it is and how much money do they have to spend on me during those 2 days at home. I feel my parents do not take me as their chid. Everytime I have a little argue with a family member (casual, nothing extreme), my father run towards me, calling me names, kicking me out of the house - without knowing what we are arguing about (like I needed computer for 30 minutes to write an e-mail but my brother wanted to watch a movie on it despite the fact he has a TV and another computer in his room...). My father calls me a bitch, @@@@@@@, frigid slut - that only declares that he very easily loses his nerves. After that incident, I decided to leave right away and do not contact them. My father told my mother not to talk to me, so it was my birthday and she only sended me a message on the phone. When I asked her why she did not respond, she replied she had healthy issues. I have finished one university and now I am attending another, thanks to my husband who is very supportive. I have traveled a lot, without help of my parents, without their money (no regular money from them since I was 19). But they still prefere my brother who was for 4 years lying in the bed in our parent´s house. They treat him like a god, giving him money and me like a stupid naive girl, like I am not able to take care of myself. I have anxiety because of that because I believe I am a stupid cow, I do not believe myself, I am trembling everytime I have a task in the school even I am doing very well and was never kicked out of any exam. I always expect failure in my life. No matter how many times I have won. I love my parents so much, I love them with all my heart and I am desperate I have no contact with them. I need their support so much but they are just not willing/capable to give it to me.... Maybe it will be better not to contact them for a period of time, not to be treated like a dumb person, make me feel guilty they do not have money because of me despite the fact I am not living with them for 10 years.... This is pushing me down, because I believe them, I believe every word they say about how incompetent I am. Is it OK to cut them off for some period of time? I am trying and feel HORRIBLE about it like I cannot stand this situation. Is there anyone else who tried to cope with it the same way? I am asking because I do not want to cause myself depression or worsen my anxiety.", "hash": "07eef5b6f49a2f09f343fe5846a3549ffada54d882577b4d0bb942d50c29dc6b"}

Ultimately, if your parents have the ability to make you feel incompetent or guilty or stupid, they can do this partly because you believe them. If you cut them out of your life, that might make it so that you don't have them saying those things to you all the time, but if you believe those things in the first place, not having them there to tell you those things won't take away your belief in what they said about you. You would still have the problems with feeling those things while you have cut them off but you will also likely feel guilty for cutting them off and alone from them, like you have lost the potential to ever have a truly loving and supportive relationship with your family because you are not in contact with them. Perhaps their behaviour indicates that you will never have a truly loving and supportive relationship with them but you don't sound convinced of this because you do say you love your parents so much. But this love might also be because their treatment of you is what you are used to and we tend to cling to what is familiar because we needed them when we were growing up (for food and shelter and stuff), even if they were abusive. An alternative to going no contact all together is to have a trial period of no contact. Pick a time frame during which you would normally see them and tell them in advance that you don't plan on seeing them during that time. See how it goes, see how it feels to you. Try to think through how you will feel in the distant future, whether you will be more or less happy with the results of cutting off contact (say for example if one day you were to have found out they were really sick or had died, are you happy or unhappy with the decision you made and why). Getting a professional to help you work through the impact of the abuse you experienced can also be helpful to you and make it easier to decide what to do. Ultimately you should do whatever it is that you think is right for you. Remaining in contact or cutting contact are both extremely hard decisions. I hope you can work out what will be right for you. Try not to think of cutting off contact with them as a magic cure for your anxieties about your abilities, those anxieties will still be there. Cutting off contact would, however, lessen the amount of emotional abuse you are experiencing (except unless they start trying to harass you to get in contact with them).

And as laws probably vary on that from location to location, the absolute best thing would be to consult an attorney.

Long story short: I've had quite a few anxiety-attacks in the past few years. Attacks I would call fairly \"normal\": around 10-15 minutes, hyperventilating, crying, but I'm able to calm myself down fairly quickly using grounding techniques. However... I had a really scary anxiety attack a couple of weeks ago, and it scared the heebie-jeebies out of me! I put myself in a situation I kinda knew I couldn't handle (theater warm-up) - but I wanted to try - and surprisingly I couldn't do it. The thing that followed then was just something I hadn't experienced before. I managed to lock myself in a bathroom and totally broke down; sobbing, screaming, flailing everything, smashing my head and fists against the walls - I couldn't control my body at all. It lasted for a good 45 minutes or something like that (didn't really have any sense of time), and it only stopped because I became too exhausted. It was a really scary and uncomfortable experience, and I really don't want it to happen again. My problem is now that my anxiety ABOUT getting anxiety attacks has risen a whole lot, and I had to stop going to performance-class and I keep to myself a lot more, which is making me more anxious and sad - and I know this kind of behavior was what led to my depression, and I just really don't want to end up there again. Do any of you lovely people have any tips as to how to handle this? I'm not able to see a psychologist on a regular basis and I live at a boarding school: being around a 100 people all the time is pretty much unavoidable.

Basically sometimes in high stress situations I am unable to talk. I don't know what to say, somehow feel as if I don't WANT to say anything and at the same time not being able to. I try to find the right words and/or thoughts to speak but I can't and I'm trying to understand why. Is this some sort of anxiety at all? It happened again just now because I had an appointment scheduled at a mental health clinic and my caretaker would take me to it. For clarification, since I'm not a native english speaker so maybe my choice of words may be wrong, I am not physically disabled, I live in an assisted living community (I hope this is the right term for it). I remember it happening in my childhood quite a bit when my father would yell at me and I would just sit there and not say anything, maybe to defy him in a way, I am not quite sure. Anyways, I am not sure where to put this... behaviour(?) of mine and I have quite a bit of trouble speaking my thoughts, writing them down seems so much easier.

I’m in my late twenties, been thru a few rough divorces and learned a lot about myself. I’ve been in therapy for the past few years and have C-PTSD, codependency, and some pretty decent anxiety. Most of this was related to a very rough childhood with a mom having schizophrenia and another disorder. Recently, I’ve been dating a gal for the past 6 months that has been great. She has her own set of issues and the initial onset of the relationship was a bit guarded on her end (which isn’t bad). We grew close and actually chose to move in together. Recently, I have noticed that I have several anxiety related thoughts and feelings and am unsure on what it is tied too. She’s very attractive and has male friends (I’m sure men know why that brings anxiety) but she has boundaries with them and doesn’t do anything to make me think anything is going on and wants me to hang out with her coworkers or friends. Also, I seem to be having a difficult time being confident with other men checking her out. With it being summer time, shorts and a tank top can often be very appealing for other men to look at and even make attempts to hit on her. I know this is natural and I should (do) trust her to turn them down and move on, but it seems to be killing my anxiety and deep fear of losing her to another man. I hate the thought of another man possibly walking away feeling like he is superior and got the attention of her behind my back or that she wants him. I realize a lot of this is tied to my insecurities, fears, etc. but wanting to know how I can become more confident or calmed with this?", "hash": "758aed7dc065b456a4d08feba43479c25e744f36cfea52fbed2caca22b737623"}

I've similar feelings at times when in a relationship, and i think it can help to talk to your girlfriend about how you feel if you can. As this might help you get a bit closer and build trust. It sounds that her wanting for you socialize with her is a very good thing as, she's being open and honest with you and including you more in her life, perhaps she also sees you as a good catch and wants to show you off as her boyfriend, just something to think about. Another thing to think about might be that she could also suffer her own insecurities and fears so its worth taking that in mind. Perhaps trying to find ways to boost your confidence could also help you, i.e. going to the gym, finding things to do which you like doing. It sounds like if you are able to deal with your anxiety and get it under control, that you can have a really great relationship with her.

We both had a lot in common, and we genuinely liked each other. Over a break in December, I went on a trip to a city (not disclosing for privacy reasons), and when I came back home and went to school, I had terrible nausea, and I felt like I was going to throw up all the way through a class, which I have w/ her. Tried to go to school the next day, and threw up early in the morning while thinking of her. Tried to go again the next day, again, threw up in the morning. At that point, I ended up staying home that whole week, expecting it to just be a stomach bug or something and that it would go away in the weekend. Nope. Tried to go in on Monday of that week, I instantly had nausea when I was putting my shoes on. I just couldn't go to school. Over the course of the next few months, I was on homeschooling and homebound instruction for school, because I was too sick to eat. During all that time, I went through countless doctor appointments, each one finding nothing. About 3 weeks ago, the doctors finally seemed to find out what was wrong (again, not saying for privacy reasons, but it's a fairly common disease). They put me on a different diet plan, but that hasn't helped. I'm definitely not convinced the disease they diagnosed me with is causing this. I'm convinced I have some kind of anxiety because of the girl. Just tonight, I was trying to play an online game with her. About 10 minutes in, I had a terrible feeling of nausea, and I went to the bathroom where I ended up throwing up. I'm convinced this was because of her (technically me). All I want more than anything is to learn what I can do for this nausea feeling to go away, so I can actually ask this girl out and not be scared of throwing up.

Our friendship is weird, he lives in New Zealand and I live in the U.S. and our connection only formed when we had came across eachother on a site. We've known eachother for three years now, and I would be lying if I said there wasn't turmoil here and there. Our arguments, if we had one, would result in an absence of talking for a while, maybe one to two weeks at the most? Well, it's the second week since we've stopped talking and I can't help but feel this stabbing pain in my stomach every time I decide to think about the situation. The thoughts range from what I could have done differently to utter resentment for him and eventually it wanes to me feeling sad that I couldn't have tried harder to maintain my composure during our dispute. For a few days I thought I was able to at least not acknowledge it, but as I was talking to another friend we both know, I had the compulsion to ask questions regarding if they still talked and let me tell you, I regretted that immediately after. Of course they still talk! They chat a couple of times a day and here I am having to endure this silent treatment for my gross handling of my emotions and frustrations. Having talked to most of my friends they all tell me that time will the wounds but right now it's not about the end of the journey but more along the lines of me needing to withstand the anxiety and jealous that runs rampant every time I decide to think about him while we are not talking. Paranoia runs through my mind regarding the situation and I just wish I could move on with my life without having to sulk over this. Even now I'm having to endure the stabbing pains of anxiety and it makes me want to curl up and sob my eyes out until I'm exhausted. The rational part of me wants to move on and wait until he's ready to talk again but the anxiety and emotional side of me is compelled to think over this until I can no longer stand it, like part of me is demanding a form of retaliation just for being ignored but I know that would make things worse. Long story short, I'm miserable. My sleep schedule is ruined over this and any time I wake up I get the sharp pangs of dread that are ready to remind me that I am still having to endure this situation. If anyone has experienced the silent treatement and tips on how to cope with it, I would love to hear any suggestion because right now I'm at my wits end trying to deal with the anxiety.", "hash": "e537fbc07d959bfe5fb034876980b142487440adf4a9a82b6bc09217ac663a71"}

Okay here's the deal lately I've been experiencing intense panic attacks at work, i've recently moved to a bigger city so I know it could be stress related but I just want answers, I'm a cook and today I had an attack where, I nearly puked, felt like I was going to pass out, had very sharp pain in my liver area anyhow I almost had to leave work, I don't consider my job stressful, I've been a cook for years...I've also been waking up exhausted and covered in sweat for the past month, I'm incredibly exhausted from the daily pain and lack of sleep, I'm currently on Zoloft 100mg and honestly I've never had more panic attacks. The truth is I also have a hard time believing the whole Generalized Anxiety thing, I'm incredibly depressed as life is just pain at this point, every day is groundhog day, wake up exhausted, force myself to eat and take meds, then the panic attack start sometimes they are bearable, I can brush them off other times I survive them and pass out for the rest of the day, I'm also very paranoid in everyday events, going out with friends has been very difficult in these last years and I used to be a social butterfly, I encouter lots of confidence issues concerning that and I have a hard time making new friends and dealing with daily tasks, like cleaning up, doing laundry, going to get my paycheck, everything requires an insane amount of energy for me, I've avoided so many situations because of this and I've also forced myself in situations that I want to do, play live shows, going to concerts, taking walks, photography, writting, etc... I often wonder if I'll ever be able to just have fun again like without having to force myself throught a panic attacks or high anxiety just for the sake of not letting this disease get the best of me.

She's had some similar episodes, but I'm still looking for advice to ride it out until it passes. We have two children, 12 and 8, but I have to consider. Most of her anxiety is in the cause of their safety and well-being, although quite a bit of it is because of her insecurities and fear of relationships (ie, she does not feel worthy of love and affection) Any advice is appreciated. The current medication is an anti-psychotic (olanzapine) and Xanax, but the therapist is recommending that the psychiatrist treat it strictly as GAD, so maybe the medication will change when we see him on Wednesday.

This is my first post here. I will try to keep it short. The last 2-3 months I've been extremely suspicious everyday on the road. I believe that people will attack me or rob me. When i see big crowds downtown i'm afraid that riots will begin (i live in Greece, so riots are quite common). Today, i saw two guys with their faces painted white and i thought they were about to rob me (inside the subway). Another day, a beggar threatened to beat me up because i told him to leave and let me do my job(i was delivering flyers outside the subway) and my heart went to 200 BPM. I must mention that i've been under extreme pressure and stress everyday because of the college and work. Too much work to do, in too little time with deadlines approaching. Besides general anxiety, i suffer from approach anxiety with the opposite sex. (i'm male 30 y.o). Many times i believe that if i approach i girl i like she will offend me badly. I know its all in my head but there is no way i can calm down and live a normal life. I'm tired of being afraid to go out. Question #1) Regarding ALL things i mentioned before , do you believe it is anxiety or psychotic symptoms? Question #2) I have a few Stelazine pills, 15mg controlled release. Do you think they will help me calm down? I have read that Stelazine causes many extra-pyramidal symptoms and i dont have Akineton to neutralize these symptoms. P.S, If there is anyone here with any experience regarding Stelazine, i would greatly appreciate any information or advice.

He is always rushing after time as if there is an emergency. His whole body gesture, his tone of voice etc ... just make one more stressed out. He is a friendly guy. When he needs me to do things for him, he would just pester me, pressurized me ... until I do things the way he wants. Otherwise, he is ok. My mum is a narcissistic and she knows how to pull my emotionally cord. She needs me to fulfilled her needs and if I don't, I feel kind of guilty. I now avoid spending too much time with her or else I feel drained out. My husband just scared the hell out of me when I tell him things like I nearly twisted my ankle on a trail. He would dramatized, make a fuss about it even over small things Sometimes he makes me so scrared that I cannot think by myself, all my common sense disappeared.

I am a highly intuitive sensitive person, an empath, kind, considerate, enjoy the simple things of life. II have also OCD and may be a little border line personality.

I'm New to psychforum I'm in the UK and I'm studying a master's degree at university. I was diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder in 2010, and will the lots of intervention I did manage to get a lot better, despite it being very severe for me. In 2013, I was diagnosed with Generalised Anxiety Disorder instead ; I still had issues when it came to socialising, but they were less severe than they'd been, but I now had problems day to day, more generally. I struggled through my undergraduate degree, and I got great grades but at times I was just not leaving the house at all for weeks, I had no friends whatsoever and I was having frequent panic attacks. After graduating, I became a bit better, managed to work in a shop, though I was using some serious coping mechanisms for this and it was a very unique setup in that I only worked with 2 other people, who I knew from primary school. I applied for a master's degree, because I thought that I was making so much progress, it was a good time to do so, but unfortunately my health has taken a huge dip. I began to get symptoms I'd not experienced before; flashbacks of abuse from my father during childhood, long dissociative periods where I couldn't remember doing important things like paying bills or walking half a mile to the shops. In 2016 I was diagnosed with complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (c-PTSD), and I am now under a community mental health team (CMHT), taking Sertraline 100mg/D and propranolol, in a new City (I relocated for my Master's), and I am again just about managing to do the bare minimum in terms of my course. Getting great grades but doing all of it from home due to being so anxious and panicky that I will have a flashback or dissociative period when I am at uni. I also suffer from systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) which, for me, causes fatigue, rashes (incl a 'butterfly' rash across my face), joint inflammation and pain. It also causes me to have attacks of scintillating scomata, which essentially means that I randomly lose my vision without warning sometimes, and this can last anywhere between 15 minutes to 3 hours. I am currently really super depressed because in the past, I have had to deal with one of these issues at once, but now I am suffering from all of them at the same time and I just feel like there is so little that I can do at the moment, and I don't have much fun, considering I am only 24! I am wondering if anyone has any advice at all on how to become more active, slowly. I have been close to incapacitated by social anxiety before, and I made incredible amounts of progress with the help of meds, CBT and other therapies. When I was 15 I genuinely thought my life was over and I'd never be able to do anything, because I could hardly leave the house, and simply couldn't do things like catch a bus at all. But the fact that I came out of the other side of that once before gives me the strength to know that I can do it again, in time (maybe a lot of time). I really am hoping to start getting better and feel like I have a better quality of life, and I'm not afraid of putting in the hard work that I know it'll take, but I'm just absolutely at a loss as to where to start right now :/. I've been considering paying for a private support worker - someone who can come with me the first few times to things that I want to be doing in the longer term, like going to the gym, or an art class, or new places in this City I've recently moved to, as I don't have the ability to make friends I can do with with right now, but I'm not sure if this would be totally sad and pathetic and I don't want to make someone feel uncomfortable, like I'm paying them for companionship. Any advice is much appreciated, and I'd love to hear all about other people's experiences too.", "hash": "b390fa8eb7c5f04d4fe066f8d538d4d0468cb13a4173cc17fd90ea9c2199565d"}

This problem has been around for a long time now, maybe 9 years now. Every time something slightly troublesome comes up, I have an overwhelming urge to cry. This can be as minor as confronting a teacher about a grade, talking to a friend about my grades, or asking my parents something related to my mental health without trying to give away too many details that I am not doing well mentally. I know this is linked to stress and anxiety. But it has come to a point where I am in a full-blown cry after my parents talk to me in a slightly hostile voice. I just don't know what to do. I cry a lot in public too, and I have to try my best to hide it with my glasses and sleeves. When a teacher calls on me to answer something, and I get it wrong, I break down. I know it sounds like this is some teenager hormone issue, but none of my other friends go through this to the degree I do. I also feel like this may have some attachment to having slight (undiagnosed) depression, but again I cry in situations that have no relation to being depressed. I know diagnosis is not allowed on this website, but I am curious to see if crying way too much is a symptom of anything else. Thanks.", "hash": "9235780e1b4efef0e83e3774875c4696798eaa6d8446c9d78d953f77613ec606"}

I worry to the point that it is debilitating. Recently, I have actually lost some weight due to not being able to eat because of worry. While I could stand to drop a few pounds, it's bad that it is happening this way. I also have an extreme fear of abandonment. That is due to the fact that I have been abandoned in the past by people who I thought were my friends. People that I loved dearly. There is someone in my life now who I absolutely love with all of my heart. This person and I share a very special bond. I know that nothing is forever, but I want this person in my life for as long as they can possibly be. For the remainder of our lives if possible. Recently, when this person failed to reply to messages, I got worried to the point that I could not function. I mean, I could not eat or sleep. I thought for certain that I had done something to make them no longer want to have anything to do with me, even though I could not think of anything that I may have done. I just knew that I had to have done something. Someone told me that I was worried over nothing. That this person not replying probably had nothing to do with me personally. I could see their point. However, what bothered me was, it just was not like this person to just flat out not respond like this. Even if they were otherwise occupied, they would always tell me that. Plus, they would even say something like \"hit me up tomorrow when I will have more time to talk\". But, this time, there was nothing. I got a really bad vibe from it. I went into such a state of worry. I broke down emotionally. Then, I tried again the next day. I figured I had nothing to lose. Also, as someone pointed out to me, if she truly wanted nothing more to do with me, then she would just unfriend and/or block me, and in fact, would have already done it by now. So, I try again the next day, and she replies and everything seems okay. I was greatly relieved, and I asked if everything was alright, because she had me worried when she did not reply the day before. She said that that had absolutely nothing to do with me. I was glad to hear that, but I still worried a little. I took that to mean that she was not replying to anyone else either. I wasn't sure, because she did not elaborate on it. I have this issue where I worry. I worry to a point that I can not think straight. It interferes with my daily life when I am in such a state of worry. I forget to do things. I walk around in a perpetual daze. I hate that I get like this. But, it seems like it is out of my control. Plus, there is the self blame. I immediately assume that something is all my fault. If someone acts strange, or out of character, then I automatically think that it is because of me personally. And even when I can't think of anything that I may have done, I convince myself that I most certainly have done something and it was completely and totally unforgivable. Should I seek professional help for this? Perhaps get on some sort of medication? I need to do something because it is to a point where I am afraid that I am going to worry myself physically sick. Or, if it gets too out of control, I may harm myself. Any thoughts?", "hash": "9fc54c2ded85fb2a7af91a4c92d0e49b597c6a263747c78270ea1e24838b505d"}

This is quite a long one so please bare with me. For quite a long time now, I cant get this guy out of my head. There's not a moment where i dont think about him. Whenever i receive messages, i always hope he's the sender. I get very happy and excited when i do get messages from him (most of the time its about schoolwork). I think about wanting to spend more time with him, and also the possible moments i'd be spending with him in the future. I wont say we're friends, more like acquaintances. He's really nice and most of the time seeing him instantly brightens my day. I really like him. There's times where he'd walk around near to my seat and observe what I'm doing, he'd go to me when he needs help understanding our lessons, and at times i see him stealing glances at me and i just pretend i dont notice. Now you could say that its just me being hopeful or im just being desperate, whatever it is, he makes me feel special. Lately, ive been very depressed, a lot of stuff just builds up and form into this one big monster of a downer. There was a time back then when i thought perhaps i have mental/emotional issues. I'm anxious about everything and for maybe the past 2 years and im gloomy more often than not, but back then i somehow managed to stay and feel \"normal\". It's not until lately that things got really worse and unbearable. I feel useless and insignificant, everything about school just makes it worse, a lot of deadlines, everyone is better than me at everything, I fear what future is there for a failure like me and on top of that, I'm lonely. I have friends but not ones I could open up to and ask help with my depressive thoughts. I have no one to ask for help, i dont have the balls to ask even my family, so i walked the darkness alone and everything just accumulated. I feel bound and isolated. If im not thinking about a particular problem, another one rears its ugly head and takes the spotlight. Day in, day out, the problems eats me up non-stop. It's like a huge truck running over me again and again. All the problems from way back, came back and stacked up with the rest. There were moments where id just cease to function. I feel like theres no future for me, or if there is, i fear its not worth living if all i will ever experience is the same pain and suffering and loneliness i am feeling right now. I felt like there was no way out. The other night, i was contemplating suicide. Amidst the cold darkness, there was that guy, the one i talked about earlier. He's my ray of sunshine. That night i was so ready to say goodbye to this world, to meet my end and be free from all the $#%^. I was laying there in my bed thinking how i'm going to kick the bucket. Ive never felt so low and utterly helpless. I breathed in and out fully accepting that day as my last, then i heard a ding! from my phone. It was him. Now he didnt say anything miraculous or holy that blessed me with the will to throw away that blade and live another day, well in a way he did. He just said 'i need help chapter 1-3'. I laughed silly at how this tiny message did all the wonders that got me up my bed, take my book, check what sorcery lies in chapter 1-3 and toss that blade away. I thought of the many great moments i have and i could spend with this guy in the future, we could even be close friends. That, im not willing to throw away. Now here's my problem. I'm afraid to lose him. In a year, we'd be graduating college. He'd be gone and we'd be going our separate ways. I'm afraid what future there wont be without him. Whats going to be my sunshine then? How am i going to find hope during dark times if he aint around? Its seems im getting obsessed with him. Thinking of losing him just adds to the still fresh wounds of depression. I know a lot can happen in a year, but right now, i need help dealing with this obsession, how do i stop relying on him as my sole saviour? how am i gonna accept the slowly but surely approaching end? Should i just forget him? How should i deal with all this? Take it how you will, for you it may seem petty or trivial, but for me, right now at this moment, it means a lot. It may hold my future of either sinking back to depression or finally moving on. Thanks. Last edited by shock_the_monkey on Thu Mar 29, 2018 1:01 pm, edited 2 times in total.

Explain to the therapist that you don't think that you are getting the level of help that you need. They should have advanced resources available, if you require them. Have you had an extensive physical exam lately? I felt much better after blood tests revealed deficiencies that are being addressed through meds and mineral supplements. Sorry about the spate of bad news. The same meds that treated my depression also treated my anxiety. Today I am doing fairly well and although the roller coaster never stops, I can handle it as I know that I can hang on for the ride. Support from others really helps. There are 12-step meetings with others that are going through exactly what you are going through. It is cheaper than therapy, but should not be considered a replacement for professional help just yet. I use 12-step meetings as an 'aftercare'. Seeing that we are not alone in our life struggles and seeing how others deal with things, gives me ideas on how to move on that I would never have thought of by myself. Best of luck to you.

I dread meeting with family most of the time. The apprehension is much worse beforehand, but it usually doesn't go so bad once I realize that it is over. I have a drunken, angry brother and sister that I cannot tolerate for very long. There are certain matters that the family must discuss and plan for together. If the phone conversation begins to stress you, get the main message across and avoid going into small talk if it begins to bother you. You can always close the conversation by stating that something has come up on your end and you need to get off the phone. Emails are impersonal to begin with. Sometimes it helps to send something humorous along with the message. Use emoticons or smiley faces to make it more personal and put the other party at ease. Choose a time when you are relaxed and open to some family-time. One thing that gets me is a stressful and seemingly pointless phone call just as I walk in the door from a stressful day and I am tired and hungry. At least with emails, I can choose the time to check them and answer them when I am ready to. Phone calls usually get me when I am unprepared for discussion. Best of luck to you.

I am a 22 year old girl with social & general anxiety, bpd, and depression. I started smoking weed recreationally when i was around 16. I was on medication, but found that most of the time I had a good high. I was carefree and laughing nonstop. I stopped smoking for a bit and when I started again, I was probably on different medications, but for the same thing-- just normal anti depressants. I've always noticed that I get significantly higher than the people I smoke with. It makes me a bit self conscious but I figured it wasn't anything serious aside from maybe a bit of an annoyance to the people who chose to smoke with me. I honestly never even considered it could be my medications mixing until I was about 18 and took one hit from a bowl and got so high that I was hallucinating. My friend that was with me at the time didn't express any concern and actually seemed quite annoyed with how panicked I was. I ended up just laying there twitching and afraid until I fell asleep. I wasn't sure why it happened but it scared the crap out of me, so I did some research, chalked it up to the weed not mixing well with my medications, and I didn't smoke for a while after that. I've hallucinated 2 other times after smoking and was terrified but at least I knew what to do when I came across that situation. In the past year or so I have been smoking weed often, usually multiple times a week. I am still on antidepressants and benzos. I still find that I get higher than the people I smoke with. When I am high, I like to be alone or with my boyfriend. If I'm around people, I get extremely anxious and paranoid and worry that I might start hallucinating or something. I also get extremely nervous that everyone around me thinks I'm high, or even if they KNOW I'm high, that they'll think I'm acting too weird. Even after my high dissipates, lately, like in the past few weeks I've noticed pretty significant paranoia, disassociation, and just a general weird, uneasy feeling. Despite all of this, I don't really want to stop smoking weed because, when the circumstances are right, I do have a really good high. It makes everything more enjoyable (especially sex lol), but ONLY if I'm alone, or with my boyfriend, who is pretty much the only person I would allow to see me high anymore. Is this normal? Has this ever happened to anyone else? If so, could you describe what happened, I'm really curious about this. I'm wondering should I just stop smoking altogether? If I don't, could anything serious happen because of the medications not interacting well with the weed? Could I go insane or something? Also wondering if it could be beneficial to come off my medications and smoke weed medically? Would the weed actually be helpful for my anxiety if I were to go off my medication? I don't want to be stupid and go off my medication, but it really isn't working for me. I'm not sure what to do. It's so confusing to me that weed actually helps some people with their anxiety when it makes me so paranoid. *****************Also, I have only smoked medical marijuana in the past year and have hallucinated once during that time. I also wasn't sure which board to post this in, so I'm sorry is it doesn't belong here!! >.< Thanks for your help guys. <3", "hash": "1ed405bbb0001478e133fbedeeec277d33da5dbd9aac57ebb646564a9283d7b1"}

I was a lightweight and definitely had hallucinations -- I think it's possible that the weed hit me so hard *because* I had anxiety, so I was very attuned to what my body was feeling so I paid much closer attention to the differences in my body than other people. Or maybe I'm just a lightweight I wasn't taking any medications at this time, so it's just definitely the way I am naturally. I kept smoking, occasionally hallucinating but usually not, and always getting much higher than everyone else. However, I started having panic attacks more and more often (incredibly anxious during and afterwards to the point where I'd feel sick) and I think they got worse because I had more and more bad experiences of being high built up. One day (maybe 9 months after I started smoking weed), I got high with my boyfriend (nothing different then usual), and he drove us to get fast food. And I got SICK. I was disassociating and had severe nausea and I thought I was going to die. I made him park the car because I was so afraid that if it moved, I'd get so sick that I'd actually die. We sat in the parking lot for four hours (I kept waiting for the high to wear off so I could calm down, but the feeling never lessened or went away) until I finally told him to take me home. When I got home, I couldn't sit up in bed for a week straight -- each time I did, I thought the nausea was too bad and I thought I'd die. I was disassociating and I felt like I couldn't see anything and nothing was real. I had to always have an apple and glass of water on my bedstand because I was convinced that if that happened to me again and I didn't have an apple or water, I'd die. My mom took me to every Urgent Care and the doctors kept telling me they had no idea what was wrong with me -- we thought it was something physical. Turns out the weed had triggered a SEVERE panic attack, which in turn triggered anxiety, severe OCD, and agoraphobia. I didn't leave my house for two months because I was so afraid that I'd have another attack and be isolated and not be able to get to a place where I could save myself from being sick like that again and dying. The disassociation was constant for those two months. For the following six months or so, I was physically able to go outside, but I still got nausea and dizziness and general panic/anxiety (so still agoraphobia) and I would have periods where disassociation would roll over me. It was terrifying. I wasn't able to ride in cars because I had severe panic attacks and disassociation for over two years, and I stopped being able to eat food because I was so afraid that it could have LSD or cannabis in it (getting high again was my worst fear and I was convinced I'd die if I had a second experience like that). I'm finally, three years later, somewhat close to as stable as where I used to be, but I feel like I lost a couple years of my life in that breakdown. I really don't think your reaction is because of your medication. Over the span of eight months, my body's reaction to weed morphed significantly, and I think it's just part of the chemicals in your body changing in your teens and twenties. My best friend, who has anxiety, OCD, and bipolar disorder, is on medications and uses weed medically. It's been incredibly helpful to her and none of my friends on medications have found a negative correspondence between weed and meds. Everyone's bodies are different and some people are helped by weed, but it's not abnormal to have paranoid and anxious reactions to weed. Recently, a few of my other friends, who have been smoking for years and didn't have much anxiety before have both gone to the ER for panic attacks that ended up turning into anxiety disorders. Weed can do that to people! It's really such a varied response. Weed can definitely be fun, but if you're already having paranoid reactions to it, I would say that's likely how your body processes weed and you shouldn't use it as your primary medication, because there's a chance it won't have anti-anxiety effects. So to answer your questions: what you experience when you get high is normal. My experience, I think, is a pretty worst case scenario, but it IS something that happens. (My dad worked in a psychiatric hospital in the 80's and a lot of the people he saw had schizophrenia induced by cannabis & LSD overusage in the 60's). I'd say that if weed so far hasn't been very helpful for your anxiety, I wouldn't use it as a primary medication -- I'd suggest finding an anxiety medication that works well for you and then choosing to smoke weed or not on top of that. In my own experience, I wish I had stopped smoking when I first noticed the panic attacks and disassociation, but so it goes. I don't think you could go insane from the medications interacting with weed, but weed by itself, especially combined with a predisposition for mental disorders CAN have negative physical and mental effects. (I'm still salty that it helps so many people and not me). Continue to smoke weed if you'd like -- it can be fun and it could be a large part of your lifestyle -- but make sure to seek other help for your anxiety and be aware that it can affect you negatively!", "hash": "0bdf092b4bf30bd8707b0d18b6f2ec13bd9c2a4aa1073c24c902de770f5ee3d2"}

Now I was on antidepressants and stimulants for 4 years and I smoked Weed regularly for maybe 2 of those years in total and went mad, got sectioned and switched to meds for bipolar disorder along with a new diagnosis. the new meds do help, and I now know that I was Bipolar, and that the antidepressants and stimulants were keeping me in a hypomanic state, and I literally always felt buzzed/anxious or on edge. Weed also does this, medical or otherwise. Weed can increase or decrease anxiety, it's a bit of a stimulant and depressant, and hallucinogen, so yes all the effects you are feeling are normal. Since I came off the antidepressants, and only take stimulants recreationally or at raves, I haven't \"gone mad\", and I have been smoking weed every day though, so this proves to me that the combination of weed and meds, or just the meds on their own were causing an increase in my anxiety, which is understandable as the antidepressants have a mania-inducing/stimulating effect on bipolar patients and stimulants are stimulants, and weeds a bit of one so, self explanitory. all you need to do now is ask yourself do you want to continue taking it, is it helping you enough to keep on taking the risk getting a hold of, and smoking , ? at least you know you wont die or anything on it!", "hash": "eb07fc6bf3aa572b01191c72e68c5ee0ec981fe0d3fb55fc6f66e803b9cb39ee"}

My depression stopped about 2 years ago shortly before my burnout, in a silent bang where I went from crying 5 times a day to feeling absolutely nothing but numbness. My depression used to give me a very high libido somehow, my emotions were all over the place then I lost it all with my libido in the matter of a day. I went on with my life hoping that my problems would go away in due time, anti-depressant didn't help as they just numbed my emotions even further. Then, I suffered a burnout at university after a really difficult schoolwork and 5 days without sleeping. I thought I was becoming psychotic or dying, these possibility have been ruled out since, but my everyday anxiety has been somewhat recurring ever since that day. After my extensive preventive checkup with my psychiatrist, I was prescribed some clonazepam for my anxiety to use about once a week when needed (I'm very scared of benzo addiction so I only take them once a month) The only thing that seems to make me happy is drinking alcohol just enough to be tipsy, it doesn't make me aggressive or much dumber than I usually am, but it makes me so much more outgoing and happy, despite the numbness in my head that never leaves me like a football player slowly crushing my skull with his elbow. So I drank some coffee today and while I usually feel empty and nonchalant, which doesn't bother me usually because of how sedated from the anhedonia, a single cup of coffee was enough to give me the worst racing thoughts and I almost immediately started overanalysing everything so promptly, logically and pragmatically like a supercomputer and answering meaningless metaphysical and philosophical questions leading nowhere, coming from nowhere, I couldn't breath for a moment. The torture never ended until I hit the hay. Does anyone have a clue what's wrong with me? Is there a way I could stop these racing thoughts from torturing me and keeping me awake? Sometimes I get these episodes for no reason, but the coffee always seems to trigger it, it's frightening and I feel like I'll lose my mind (there it is, another racing thought that keeps coming back: \"am I losing my mind?\")", "hash": "76e58a2c65a41232b68afa32953ed088e497fa566b762d9bb682b9a958c33524"}

While I am now at least able to function at work, eat again, and not feel nauseated all day I have run into a new problem.

I've had high levels of anxiety pretty much forever, and I see a psychologist regularly who uses CBT. I find CBT extremely useful, and I feel so much better for challenging my thinking, especially when I am consistent with using mindfulness. I feel like my anxiety is so much more under control, although I do have sleep disturbances and a few strange things popping up (like becoming obsessed with worry that I've left my oven on for no rational reason at work, worrying all day then coming home and of course its not) and what I call anxiety dreams. Despite this, day to day I am feeling better. The only thing, I also experience bruxism (excessive jaw grinding in my sleep) causing headaches and pain, which so far treatment has been unsuccessful, and neck/shoulder pain which is limiting and possibly related to the bruxism. I have looked into alternate treatment for the bruxism- I have been to countless dentists, use a mouth guard at night and now see a chiropractor but I would love something more effective. I have come across botox being used to relax the jaw muscle, and when I saw my doctor I asked her opinion about it. She said that the jaw problems are 100% anxiety, and to properly deal with it I need to address the anxiety effectively- using botox would be just a bandaid (in her opinion.) Since I am already doing CBT and mindfulness (and I think my psychologist is great) she thinks I should try antidepressants. I have NEVER been on antidepressants before and am a little wary of doing something that would be altering my mind, particularly as my anxiety isn't what I would say is terrible (IE I haven't been to hospital or had anything really drastic) what I am really wanting is a reduction in these physical symptoms. I have no idea about medication and worry about dependence and just prefer to manage things naturally HOWEVER it has been years and the jaw/neck pain is a real issue for me.

So I am 23 years old, and I dealt with anxiety starting at 5 years old, got on Zoloft at age 10 for extreme OCD and anxiety and wanting to die because it was so bad. It helped. I started smoking weed when I was 17. Tried mushrooms 3 times when I was 19, the first time I had an extreme realization of being alive and just how amazing everything is. I started to try to ween myself off of Zoloft, which I did over the course of about 6 months. During that time a lot of anxiety came back. I then tried a mild form of a hallucinogen called 5-meO-DMT, which is that first time I experienced a sense of depersonalization or derealizarion. It was a feeling of hyper-awareness of how your body is commanded by your brain without you actually having to make yourself move, and also a feeling of lagging in mental response time. Any way, after I did that, I couldn’t smoke weed anymore because it caused me to have a lot of anxiety. The hallucinogens I have tried have caused feelings in me I had never felt before, most of them were unpleasant, and I still feel them sometimes. After I tried DMT (at age 20), I ended up taking Effexor for about 5 months, in combination with Abilify for about the first 2 months, but now I don’t take anything and I honestly have moments that I’ve never felt better than ever. I also felt pretty great my first 2-4 years of taking Zoloft. I tried smoking weed again for a while but had to stop due to it causing me to have paranoid thoughts, mostly dissociative feelings, or derealization. I honestly cannot explain how it made me feel. I guess you can say it was depersonalization but not really. I just felt or maybe had the thought even that nothing around me is real, it just feels like a dream that doesn’t feel real in a way. But during those moments I can also have extreme realizations about reality. ..... So the point of this post is that sometimes, my anxiety gets so low in a way (I say this because it seems as though sometimes my anxiety levels get so low, that I start to have anxiety in a different way because I’m not used to not having anxiety, so feeling different scares me). It’s like everything starts to feel so real that it starts to feel unreal. It’s like I’m having a new perspective that I don’t know how to interpret. I start to literally feel like this isn’t real, everything is not actually existing just a projection, or something like that. It’s weird because in a way I feel like I almost always have some for of dissociation, but just from general stress or anxiety. It’s like when you’re stressing out in your head, you’re not totally emotionally or mentally engaged in what’s going on around you, and you don’t feel as connected as you want to. But it’s not that things feel unreal in a sense as they do when you’re having a derealization attack. I really need help, advice, maybe something to help myself or say to myself. I tell myself, “everything is real. It’s okay. Relax. You’ll be okay.” And I pray a lot. It ends up going away. But can anyone explain this? Or help me to feel better about it or have any tips to cure that? I honestly do not want to take artificial medication.

Some background: I've been living at home since graduating college 2 years ago, worked at a job in my hometown. I consider myself ambitious, hardworking, independent. My anxiety and stress had been building ever since I moved home, until it got so debilitating I had to quit my job in June. I felt paralyzed, had derealization/DP. Panic attacks were insane. I felt a desperate need to escape, I felt extreme rage and resentment at my parents, I felt I was ready to explode/snap. It was like I had had ENOUGH of them (especially my mom). I've been seeing a therapist about this since October -- I felt therapy helped a lot, and I was so focused on it and made progress in terms of the issues with my mom. It was like we uncovered the root cause of my issue/anger. However, it's now January (almost Feb.) and I feel like reality has hit me -- I haven't reached the goal I wanted in therapy yet, and I realized I have to move on with my life. I feel like complete S**T because I regret not having taken a break following the breakdown in June -- I was in horrible shape but I felt like if I had gone away from my parents maybe I would have been better. But a part of my mind was like maybe I need to grow from this and get my anger out? And experience a breakthrough? I feel like a piece of $#%^, and so stupid for continuing on with this situation.

She kept trying to give me projects, because her line of work is related to what I used to do. This was on top of my main job...where I was an assistant manager. Everything you're saying sounds like me around that time. Therapy can take a really long time. I've been going (for many things) since January of last year. I go once a week, and still have many of my bad habits. Still I've lost many of them, so I know it's helping. Though it may be depressing and stressful to you, I wouldn't recommend taking on much more till you become more calm. My mom (though not much in my life anymore) instilled a need to always need to be doing something, and preferably something useful. It makes things extremely stressful when trying to relax.

At this point, I still had no idea why I wasn't sleeping (both having trouble getting to sleep and staying asleep) so I first tried sleeping pills, but they only worked for about a couple of days until my system got used to them. It wasn't until I started taking an antidepressent that my sleep gradually returned to normal. It took me TWO YEARS to figure out that all I needed was an antidepressant to get my sleep to return to normal. I now completely understand how some people are just simply chemically off-balance and need medicine, and how no amount of talking will ever resolve some people's mental health issues... because in my case, I don't have anxiety about anything in particular so there's really nothing to talk about, since my anxiety is \"very general\". I also had a very good upbringing with no trauma, but have also been a quiet anxious guy my entire life (although, like I said above, it wasn't until I hit about age 31 that my sleep started to be affected negatively, which caused me to quit my job and move back in with the parents). So in my case, it's just my chemistry is off and wasn't caused by any kind of trauma. I also don't ever have panic attacks either... it's just a very \"general\" anxiety (which I think causes me to live a very simple life, because with a simpler life I have a lot less anxiety).

I know that alcohol caused some 'unpredictable' problems for me in my past and I chose to stop drinking. I can still attend gatherings and relax, I just drink plain, fizzy seltzer or fruit juice.

It might be worth you seeing if you relate to the Dissociative Experience Scale: dissociative-identity/topic65082.html You might not... But what you described made me think of how it's like to experience co-consciousness with another part. Keep in mind I'm heaps biased though given that I have a dissociative condition. If you really want to know what is going on, the best thing to do is always going to be to consult a professional... In a way, I am not defined by my dissociation. In a way, I am.

I've been seeing a therapist for a few months but she has only mentioned panic attacks. Once the possibility of past trauma came up when I had a spontaneous screaming episode but I don't have any memories of trauma (don't have many memories of home life at all before age 12-13...i thought it was all happy, but now I wonder...) I hadn't considered alters b/c I don't dissociate or lose time, but I wasn't aware of co-consciousness... in a way that idea kindof fits. What is that like exactly? Before each episode I get this feeling like something wants to come up and out of me, but I need complete privacy and to sort of let the feeling take over my brain and emotions. If I let it (and have privacy), then the words start coming and my voice says them out loud, as if from a second brain that I never knew I had. But my \"regular brain\" is always still present, and I think I could suppress the words and feelings if I wanted to. Can people with alters do that? My impression was that alters come out uncontrollably and They are more \"separate\" from one's primary self. I'm too embarrassed to ask the therapist about this... i'm pretty functional overall and I think she (T) thinks I over-interpret stuff.", "hash": "e97e1be60d71c5277214d757000107af3f57be2424724ee6347bbadf0eb1d8cb"}

Im scared increasing the medication will make me gain even more. I have considered purging or not eating, which I know is a bad idea. Im anxious about taking my medication in general so I hate any kind of change around it. Im afraid I will get side effects. Im especially TERRIFIED of developing Serotonin Syndrome which is deadly I thought I was doing ok, I have been heaps better so I didn't think I'd need to increase it. I will admit I have still been anxious and on top of all of my other anxieties some new obsessive and intrusive thoughts have been occurring, for example I got house plants in my room and I'm afraid that they will cause me to suffocate or hurt me at night because they respire and release carbon dioxide and use oxygen. Im also afraid that putting hoodies under the door (I do this to make a barrier so spiders can't crawl under the door while I sleep, I'v been doing it for over a year) will cause me to suffocate in my sleep from a lack of oxygen. So I can see why they think we should increase it, however I have been doing much better than when I wasn't. Also I have been feeling really bad about myself mainly due to my weight and hips & stomach. I have considered not eating or throwing up, which I know is a bad idea, I'm a psych student so I understand how quickly it can develop into mental health issues, but I hate my body and I haven't bought new clothes in 2 years because nothing fits and I cry and have a breakdown everytime I go shopping for clothes becuase I feel increadibly fat and nothing i want fits or suits my body so I have given up. So I just cry in change rooms get in a bad mood and want to die so I just complain and go home and be miserable.

I’m new to the forum. A quick background about me is I have suffered from debilitating anxiety since I was middle school. Even as a child I was extremely shy and anti social so unsure if it goes back that far but middle school is when I really noticed it affecting my life. Fast forward to November of last year when I had a nervous breakdown and because of it lost my job. I was absent a lot or left early. I just couldn’t keep focusing on work. I wasn’t happy, I got divorced in 2015 and ever since I’ve dealt with a very vindictive narcissistic ex who would do anything it seems to hurt me and take my money. We have a 3 year old little girl between us. I’m a very loving father and I wanted the family she didn’t. Well anyway at the time my ex was dating someone who’s been in and out of jail and was just a bad guy and I didn’t want him around my daughter. The stress of untreated anxiety and panic disorder toppled with that just drove me to a nervous breakdown. I was in and out of the hospital 3 times in one month. Since I have been put on an anti depressant for the first time as I have refused ever since and it has worked wonders. My anxiety is almost entirely under control however I do not understand and this brings me to the point of this post....ever since my nervous breakdown I can’t stick with any jobs. I have quit 2-3 at this point this year. I don’t seem to stay longer then 2-3 months. I currently work from home and believe it or not I’m still feeling like I can’t stay. I’m already so close to quitting and it’s only been 2 months since I started. Don’t get me wrong I really like my job but I still somehow can’t make myself take calls all day. It’s like I can’t take being stuck behind the desk all day taking customer calls when I could spend the day doing what I want like spending time with my daughter basically just being happy doing what I want. I’m not sure if it’s anxiety or Work aversion which of course is related to being burned out. I want a job I can drive around and be free not stuck behind a desk taking call after call. I think I’m burned out possibly but to better explain how I feel it’s like this.... All of a sudden last week I was hit with the impulsive feeling that's been with me since I was 15. I wanted to quit my job and just go, run. It's a feeling I've had so many times I can't remember. I don't want this to sound like i'm lazy or have a bad work ethic because I don't but schedules and the responsibility of life have always made me filled with anxiety, extreme depression, and impulsive behaviors. It drives me crazy that I feel this way. I'm 25 and I've quit every single job I've had within the first 6 months (sometimes the first week) and the longest job i've ever had was 2 years, although I was miserable and somehow made myself do it. As I'm typing this I've called into work for the 2nd day in a row because I couldn't even bring myself to go (i've surprised myself that I called in and didn't just quit). It fills me with complete dread just thinking about going. I've tried to explain this to people in the past but when I feel this way it's almost like there's an invisible wall that's blocking me from going. Maybe like an invisible wall in my head that just won't let me do what I have to do because I'll put it through the anguish of dealing with it. Honestly I don't know....I guess I'm so upset because I thought things were actually going better and than this impulsiveness comes right back and seems to ruin everything as usual. I can't even talk myself through it anymore. It completely overtakes my mind and I just want to run. I even ruin good opportunities and jobs because normally 3 months into it I become so depressed, bored, and anxious that quitting is the only time I feel relief. But than it's a never ending cycle and at this moment I feel more lost than I ever have. I don't know if I'm looking for advice or just needing a community to vent to but I do know I need help.", "hash": "cf8c152c0d92fd26d43493f2d00f04da7c307bb2de9026402ae34ef230018854"}

I was diagnosed with panic syndrome earlier this year, and I had to take antidepressants for about 2 months, but I stopped for fearing becoming addicted. Since then the panic attacks are no longer so intense, but the \"anxiety\" persists. My symptoms are as follows: - Light chest pain during the crisis - Muscle tension, especially near the veins - Tiredness and body pains - Pressure around the head, as if they were squeezing my skull - Lack of appetite and stomach pain This symptom is more recent, but I also can sense a strange smell every time I get a little nervous. It's not necessarily a bad smell, it's just weird, and it gets much worse when I'm preparing food. Thanks to this, and the pains in the stomach, I lost a lot of weight in the last few months. My blood pressure is always great, and I've had blood tests, but no problem at all. All the doctors (I've seen many) have come to the conclusion that it's anxiety, but still, I can not convince my brain of that. Nowadays I'm better because I've been forcing myself to leave the house and being surrounded by people makes me feel safer (if something bad happens, someone can take me to the hospital) but when I'm alone for too long, it's terrible. I would really appreciate your help. I'm moving out of my mom's house in 2018 and I'm gonna have to live on my own because I'm going to college, so I can't go on like this. I didn't want to depend entirely on medicine either, but what do you guys suggest? I really can't find help anywhere else.", "hash": "0a65fdcea3bf851399e0daf9d9ee44fccf95abef171d0a39cbc80f5e3137f5fc"}

Somniphobia. by JusticeXI » Mon May 02, 2022 7:56 am Do you like being in a mania or hypomania state? But when you go to sleep it could all end waking up with Manic Depression. Here's my story how I became fearful of falling asleep or Somniphobia. I've been off my meds and when this happens, I usually get manic or experience hypomania in which I can do anything even elevate to a higher consciousnesses. I vibrate at a high frequency’s that will make electronics go haywire. I can even start to manifest certain things into my life. However just like everything else what has a beginning must have an end. When it ends, its so over and I mean it’s over to the point of complete opposites. I can no longer be that sharp witty employee or do the important things in my life like cooking food or paying my bills or anything that requires the slightest bit of energy. I won't clean my house or go grocery shopping or even talk on the phone. I get stuck in bed for days and everything I worked on comes to a complete stop. This makes me feel inadequate or being a big failure. Lately my depression has gotten worse and the sad part is I never know when exactly it will happen. Sometimes I wake up feeling so horrible that it’s easy to say I wish I was dead than to feel like this. Then one-night it hit me. If I just don't go to sleep it will continue perhaps for one or two more days. With my mind going into a racing thoughts mode, its easy to stay on this pace even if I try to sleep, I can't because I'm just to wound up. The first time I tried it, wow it worked just like I thought. The next morning I was a little slow but after a good breakfast and some juice I was right back on track. I didn’t feel bad I felt great. So now its been 6 months and I try to stay awake for a least one or two more days then the following night. When I do I go to sleep its very late and only with the help of my night meds. I ran out of my night meds so now It's going to be a very bumpy road with the possibility of a complete breakdown. Not knowing how depressed I’m going to feel, how long, or how intense it will be. I'm borderline psychotic now from a lack of sleep. I want to say I'm thinking clearly but I'm not able to make sound judgements. I not too worried because I'm the king of procrastination. So far that’s what has worked for me in my life. Just let go and Let God.", "hash": "421c89672375b0e02ffe3b36488b5c7bfc6cd926ca7fa18d0131494af4dddf73"}

I'll start off saying I have had some of these symptoms on and off for a few years like occasional clusters of night sweats, vivid dreams and I've struggled with excessive day time sleepiness since I was about 14, but only gotten worse as I've gotten older. (26 now) It went from a day nap after school to now I can spend all day and night in and out of sleep without feeling much better. I could get a full 8- 12 hours sleep then a few hours later be so tired I can't keep my eyes open and have to go back to bed. Over the last 8 months things have taken a complete nose dive though. I've been back and fourth the doctors for blood tests and a chest xray but they are all coming back fine and there last option is to lower my antidepressants as they think it could be them causing the worsening issues but I'm not so convinced. I've been waking up every 4 hour without fail, then a few hours later falling back asleep. Almost every time I sleep I have vivid dreams/ sometimes nightmares/ sometimes nothing but the most troubling thing is I'm wake up drenched in sweat, feeling weak and unable to move. I feel almost like I'm stuck between wake and sleep, unable to pull myself out of bad dreams properly, mentally I feel terrible, groggy, disorientated with brain fog which lasts up to 30 minutes. My limbs are heavy and limp and take all my energy to move, I feel woozy and loose my balance and feel not myself and almost euphoric. I wake up craving sugar too. Recently I've started waking up with my feet and hands all contourted but interlocking so it's even harder to move which doesn't help the horrible feeling of waking up drenched in sweat. Sweating from my neck, chest and all down my legs. I've tried changing loads of things to see if anything helps but it hasn't, I tried eating very healthy for 6 months straight, I changed what time I eat so not to eat several hours before sleeping, tried eating before bed, reducing sugar, eating more sugar incase it was hypoglycaemia, quit smoking. I don't do drugs, occasionally drink alcohol, don't drink tea, coffee or energy drinks, only water. I have light bedding designed to be cooling, silk pillow, light cotton pjs and shorts even with no clothes on, windows open in winter, even at different houses and I still have the same issues almost constantly. I'm more exhausted since not being able to sleep longer that 4 hours and with all the sweating it's draining and getting my mental health down. I have thought maybe I have narcolepsy for the last few years due to all the day time sleepiness but the doctors haven't looked into it or anything else sleep disorder related. As a kid I always struggled getting to sleep and suffered nightterrors which I still occasionally get. I used to be a very active kid who would function off 4 hours sleep but since my teenage and 20s things just keep getting worse and I don't know what's causing what and if I'll ever sleep properly again. Any help or advice is greatly appreciated!", "hash": "86ba43790ad9f7a34cd4bcabcdd601e207fa1d69ed25784c73098cdae1a0397a"}

At night, even if I have forced myself to stay awake all day, I can’t seem to fall asleep at night. However it isn’t like this all the time and I can fall asleep at night sometimes. In the car or if I am sitting for long periods of time, I have definitely nodded off and fallen asleep for a few mins. Another thing I have been struggling with is constant nightmares. Not scary or unrealistic nightmares either, my nightmares always include people I know and they are scarily realistic situations. I have dealt with some traumatic events in the past couple years so I thought maybe my PTSD is making things worse. I also have had depression for years (specifically Dysthymia or chronic depression).

I often see bugs or spiders - and it's almost hyperrealistic, and I panic, might scream, turn on the light, see that it's not there & I'm shaking for up to 2 hours afterwards and then I have to sleep with the light on all night. It's terrifying and really inconvenient. I'm starting to think that's why I prefer sleeping during the day, because it's not nearly as intense in daylight. I just want it to stop.

I really need some help with Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome (DSPS) which seems to be getting worse. Sleep time is now 6 - 8am so you can imagine, this is making life very difficult indeed. I have trawled the internet looking for answers and I'm just wondering if anyone has ever been 'cured' of this, and if so, how? There are lots of descriptions of symptoms out there by fellow-sufferers (which are almost a carbon copy likeness of my symptoms...which is reassuring) but very few actual answers or effective solutions! I was diagnosed by a specialist sleep clinic, but unfortunately they are being.....well, politeness stops me from finishing that sentence. They have put me on melatonin which I've been taking for about a year and have prescribed funky yellow sunglasses which cut out blue light. I have tried staying awake all night, I've tried setting punishing alarms to wake me up, Ive tried using a light box, but none of these things helped at all. I am taking medication for sleep (and other things), chiefly zopiclone, which helps, but doesn't knock me out - the stubbornness of the resistance to going to bed always wins. I'm thinking that some sort of schedule plus all the above, plus self-discipline might hold a solution somehow but I can't work it out. (Honestly, I'm not that good at self-discipline but am getting desperate.) The only other approach I've read about is just to give in to it & lead a nocturnal existence. I don't want to give up on this though, as it's seriously curtailing my opportunities for a fulfilling life. I have several co-morbid conditions, the worst of which being Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (M.E), sleep apnoea (now well-controlled by CPAP) and Emotionally Unstable (Borderline) Personality Disorder, which manifests itself as anxiety and depression. I have been on anti-depressants for years and my GP is being very helpful re meds at the moment and we are trying other meds to try to control anxiety & mood swings. (The Community Mental Health Team are useless.) I have finally found a good, long-term counsellor/therapist who I see every week & she really is brilliant. I think I have achieved more recovery in the 9 months I've been seeing her than I have for years, so I have hope there. Anyway - please forgive the length of this post but I wanted to give as much relevant background info as possible. I am prepared to do pretty much anything to sort this but I'm really not sure how to proceed. Thank you for reading this and many thanks in advance for any help you can give.

Hi all, I dont think Ive ever posted on this site but I lurked around a lot before finally making an account a few months back and now I have a question... I have multiple psych conditions including... Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, CPTSD, OCD, Agoraphobia, and Major Depressive Disorder. Lately... like the last month... ive been sleeping ridiculous amounts and im still exhausted. I dont know what's going on and am unable to get a therapist and psychiatrist for atleast another 4 weeks due to an insurance change (I was recently declared Seriously Mentally Ill and in my state they then put you on an integrated insurance program that combines physical health and psych health - it takes time to get it all activated and such though.) Basically my sleep habits have looked like this: sleep 9 hours, up 4, sleep another 6, up 36 hours, sleep 6 hours, up 3 hours, sleep 18 hours, up 2-5 hours, sleep 3-5 hours, up another 36-48, sleep another 15... continue on and on and on. Im waking up in sweats, nauseous, anxious, and exhausted. Before this started I had about 5-6 months of such vivid dreams I couldn't tell when I was awake vs asleep, which was frightening. Now those dreams are completely gone, im not getting stuck in dreams like I was - the cycle of falling asleep, dreaming, waking up in another dream, then another, then another. But now it's like I cant get any actual rest? I thought I was just really depressed, my living situation is currently less than ideal so I thought that was it.... but this seems like more than depression (which Ive been dealing and struggling with for over 20 years.) I dont know if Ive made any sense... im just at a loss... ive googled and tried to force myself to only sleep a certain amount of time but then I just fall asleep sitting up... Ive tried forcing a schedule but then I just lay in bed all night \"trying\" to sleep and not actually doing it. Ive always had issue sleeping at night but nothing this severe. Im not on any medication; previously I was on prozac, risperidone, trazodone, and benadryl. Im open to any and all suggestions, thoughts, ideas... I appreciate anyone reading this.

My dreams are normally extremely weird and jumpy with sometimes it being mundane and other times it being fantasy.

For example when I wake up if I enjoy it enough I can easily fall back asleep with the same \"theme\" , but sometimes it jumps to another \"scene\". I can control myself in the dreams and it feels like im \"in there\" not just waking up and remembering. I've never questioned if a dream really happened and accept that they are just dreams. I can easily remember in vague detail dreams i've had over two years ago better than some events in my life. Is this normal? I recently registered here because last night I had the most vivid dream ive ever had to the point where I could hear the snow crush beneath my feet and see the snow fall as well as having a superhero fight(think Avengers civil war) were it was that everyone was fighting not just me if that makes any sense?

Congrats that you can control your bipolar without taking meds. Of course I am curious what you are doing to control it. I am F25.8 Yes, I have very vivid dreams myself, high resolution, dolby surround and technicolor and even smells Additionally I have a body in my dreams most of the time, and of course I feel its position and moves and the haptic input and temperature. Sometimes this dreams are very hard to explain because magical things happen with changing perspectives, structures and twisting plots. Sometimes I have a bit of control, but that is not always the case, especially if the plot is about conflict, which I have very often. And yes, I can continue my dreams after a short time of being awake. Sure, the are „only“ dreams, but they determine my mood and in fact I need some time to get ready for the day, and I have flashbacks during the day. I think it is the wrong question to ask if that is „normal“. Some people remember their dreams, some don’t. Most people would wish they could remember them. You can train that to a little extent. Somewhat it is a gift. I would not worry if it does not affect your everyday stuff in a negative way. It is nice you can turn a nightmare into something else. I have read that is a advanced technique for lucid dreamers. So it is cool you can do it, others need years to get there. There are dream interpretation groups, I am sure they would be happy to have you! My therapist offers such a group where people share their dreams and get a psychological interpretation from her. Possibly that is something you would enjoy too. I am sure there are such groups on the web as well. My fav dream, about 8 months old: I was a walrus, escaping from an inuit hunter by swimming into a cave of an iceberg Sorry I have no interpretation for that, but it felt good to be such a strong and successful creature… Do not worry, I think everything is alright. Do you want to share a dream here? Could be fun to have a thread for it, eh?", "hash": "90837521bf111f4560b6e54681aae70434cfe873459341a1666275630a333bce"}

We are in a hall, the tables standing in a horseshoe arrangement, preparing for a party. People walk around, working on the decoration, the band is playing already in warm up mode, early guests are coming in. The scapulae are needed for the rhythm-machine, they need to be filled in a container from where they will drop out on a drum’s membrane. I am in a hurry, we will launch in a couple minutes. The room quickly fills up. I am late. The people disturb me. I need room for my bowls, but they put snacks and confetti and paper streamers on the tables.

Silence. Everybody stares at the office door. I am fatalistic. The worst case did come true. Suddelnly the door opens, and the band starts to play in forte. Everybody is on their feet now. Assistant and boss come out, wearing tuxes. They have weiqui bowls in their hands and shake them. The assistant wears the black stone bowl, and the boss the one with the white stones. The stones are not visible, but I know it nevertheless. They play the part of the machine that I failed to feed. After the tune the boss delivers a short speech. Everyone applauds. Champagne is served. The boss comes over to my seat. He asks: „How much did we pay you for the seven days around christmas? Anyway, I will cut that to three days because of your failure.“ I get angry and answer: „You know what, I am quitting. Obviously you can do all yourself.

The motivation for my wanting - or, rather needing - to know this information can be understood by reading the following description of my experience of just such an event occurring: I have had problems with sleep for most of my life and, as a result, was hooked up to a machine to monitor my sleep while in a hospital several years ago. After laying in bed, waiting to fall asleep for around an hour or so, the study was interrupted by someone accidentally entering the room, directly after which I was informed that I had been awakened by the intrusion. I, however, contested this notion, because I had been awake the entire time - entirely aware of every little noise in and outside of the room; I had simply been in the same meditative-like state that I always put myself into when attempting to sleep. I have a lifetime of experience with being in this state, which I can stay in for hours without ever actually falling asleep at any time. While in this state, I am always completely aware of my surroundings, and I always appear to be asleep - to the degree that everyone who witnesses me in this state claims that I am mistaken about being asleep - as they are invariably \"positive\" that I had been asleep. The test-giver told me that there was no possible way the machine would read as if I was asleep if I had not been, and, upon giving a detailed and accurate account to them of all of the little noises that had occurred while I was registered as being asleep (i.e., I knew exactly how many pages she had flipped in her book, how many times she had coughed, and the entire content of each of the individual conversations that were going on down the hall from my room's closed door between nurses and patients - verbatim), she became quite frustrated with me, quickly escalating to a level of anger that included her acting rather childish, accusing me of lying, stopping the test entirely, and, much to my chagrin, completely refusing to finish the test. I had been admitted to the hospital due to symptoms that were related to sleep deprivation, so it was – at the very least - disheartening, when I was told that I should simply take extra sleep medication, as I was already prescribed a rather excessive nightly dose of two high-powered medications that target sleep disorders.

My wife can't resist sleepiness by Isildur11 » Sat Jul 29, 2017 7:04 pm Hi everyone, I search around the internet but could not find any clear answer to the question I have. Here is the thing: my wife is a pretty active person, but every time she feels even just a little sleepy, she gives in, even if she is sitting at the desk, lays her head down and sleeps. It's stronger than her, I am not sure exactly how to describe it, but it's definitely not like a normal nap. Her eyes start closing without her apparently wanting to, things start mixing in her head at the point she doesn't get what I say anymore, and just starts sleeping. Even if she is standing, as soon as she feels the \"urge\" to sleep, she just sits or lays down, and sleeps. It's like she doesn't have control, or doesn't want to have control (quite often I complain to her cause it really seems she just wants to sleep cause it's \"too strong to resist\", even if something important needs to be done, or we are actively making projects or working) I am not sure if it's a case of sleep disorder, but if it can help, a couple times she kinda scared me in the night with a few cases of shouting (I believe), kicking me by moving too much and I think apnea (though I can't tell since I was just half awake when it happened). Most of the other times I saw her sleeping she was just normal, but these few cases made me wonder. It's getting frustrating since she wakes up at 8 every day and basically drops around 9pm even if she just stays in the office during the day, or has a relaxing one. It seems to be getting worse with the summer heat, so I wonder if it's related. As a side note, if she gets interested in something, even during the \"about to fall asleep\" phase, she just \"wakes up\" and doesn't sleep until, say, midnight. Boredom? Disorder? I would like to help her cause she feels frustrated too at times, especially if we watch a movie, or sorry if we have something important to do Looking for some insights from the experts Thanks in advance p.s. she is Japanese, and yes, they do sleep in the train too.", "hash": "17a9701564aba30fd41a28b922d69ad1f95c62f05f4dd87bbfb11073fb4e89ef"}

I'll try to explain. I work at a school so back in the spring my schedule was fine. I'd go to bed around 12am and get up at 8am for work. I would be really tired initially but wake up once in the shower, and I'd be okay until 12am. Then in the summer I did summer school and that started earlier, so I had to wake up at 7am for that. I felt zombie like and miserable all morning. It was only a half day so I'd come home around 1:30pm and need a nap. I would try to get to sleep earlier at like 11pm but I couldn't fall asleep until after 12am and I was miserable every morning getting up so early. It's like I'm the opposite of normal people, I can only go to sleep late and wake up late. Now I have a few weeks off before I start regular school again and I may be going to an earlier school in the fall. So I may have to get up at 6:30am starting soon. I'm worried about it. But now that I'm not working, I sleep way too late and I can't control it. Last night I went to sleep at around 2:30am, so I figured I'd be awake at 10:30am or so. No, I didn't wake up until 1pm. I had an alarm set for 9am but I hit snooze few times and I guess I accidentally turned it off. I don't want to sleep this late on my days off, too many sunlight hours wasted. I talked to my friend about it who's a morning person and she thought it was the weirdest thing, sleeping that late. She laughed and couldn't believe it. So why do I need so much sleep?

I’ve had quite a battle with sleep over the years that started during childhood. To keep this from being a novel, I’ll attempt to simplify how I have been in recent times and what appears to be my issue today. I worked an 8 AM to 5 PM shift as a night owl for over 12 years until recently. When working that schedule, I would function the best when taking a nap right after work at 5 PM – anywhere from 2-3 hours. I would then get back up and function well all the way through the end until going to bed. I was typically slow to rise, but would often be able to shake it off and was extremely productive this way. Why not just 8 hours in a row? Well, it seemed as if the longer time I slept in one setting, the worse I felt. The occasions when I would “crash” and go to bed in the early evening are the nights when I would wake up sore, dazed, confused, etc. These nights I could often recall dozen(s) of dreams over the course of the day. I realized that it seems the longer I sleep, the more I dream. The more I dream, to which many I remember, the more tired I am when I wake up – and I frequently wake up. I heard the argument for years that I needed to adjust my “sleep hygiene”, but it always failed me. Finally, I started another job in February of this year. I had to do different shifts at first, but now find myself on the shift I wanted – noon to 8:30 pm. I can now stay up as late as I want and sleep in. I never don’t get at least 6 hours of sleep; typically at least 8 hours of sleep. So now I’ve put the theory to the test. The crazy thing is I’ve been doing this since July, and I feel awful – and I believe it’s the same reason as before. I am getting too much sleep in one setting. I’ve never heard of this being an exact problem for anyone. I wake up with blood shot eyes, like I’ve been up all night or just finished doing drugs. It’s embarrassing. I am slow to rise, as I always am, but typically am able to shake it off as I get up and alert. Within a few hours, I’m in desperate need of caffeine to continue the day – now after getting adequate rest in one setting, which is how you are “supposed to do it”. I recorded myself sleeping last year, and I’ve found that I frequently swing my legs back and forth (I bend the knees, then swing my legs most often). I often talk, but I do not sleep walk. As I mentioned, I wake up often. I was in the middle of seeing a sleep doctor right before I left my old job, and I’m going to have to start the process all over as insurance kept denying a sleep study (That’s Blue Cross Blue Shield for you). Has anyone ever experienced this “deep sleep” phenomanon? I can recall so many dreams over the course of a day, particularly when I get a lot of sleep, that sometimes they are disturbing, sad, etc.", "hash": "5cbc4cd419b2c44a8502b13c241dce82bfdb0ecbfb97606a5f4b1a25c593c29d"}

It comes and goes, sometimes gone for long periods and sometimes stays for long periods. It's here now. When I get in bed and fall asleep, the moment as soon as I am asleep, I am JOLTED awake by what I perceive to be a heart attack. I know it's not a heart attack. But,I have the perception that my heart feels like it is completely stopped, I grab my chest to see if my heart is still beating, and my head feels startled and dizzy due to the extreme fear that I am now about to die. Then I calm down, and the process repeats itself on and on on every few minutes. If I am lucky, I finally fall asleep and stay asleep. Sometimes this goes on for hours and hours. I get angry, and have even cried after hours of these jolts and no sleep. No sweats, no racing heart, no gasping for air. Just a heart-jolt and fear, over and over again. Occasionally I will let out a scream of fear, as some of the jolts are particularity stronger than others. Again, when I finally do get to sleep, I sleep like a baby. When this issue rears its head, it is also usually accompanied with me being able to hear and feel every heartbeat as I lay in bed. I guess this is a form of palpitations? At work, during the day, no issues with palpitations, very little anxiety/depression anymore. This only happens as soon as I lay down to rest/sleep. I have changed so much over the past 15 years, cut out caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, all three for long periods of time. I have been on ant depressants, anti anxiety meds, had EKGs, I have had a sleep study and no apnea was identified. This issue seems to follow me despite all of this. Happens during naps, in cars and airplanes, hotels, and at home. I know as soon as it is here, as it has been the past week, it will one day be gone, and then back again.

Let me first assure you that despite how difficult feeling tired can make things, with a little effort you can make a change. So try to stay calm during this period of difficulty in your life which WILL change. I have made a huge amount of effort to help myself when I was going through what you have (and believe me it was incredibly close to what you described - including nightmares). I did it basically because life is short and I want to enjoy it and live it at least at 50%, but not feeling at 2% every day. So the bad news is there is no magic pill for this (besides moving house if you believe you might be allergic to something in the house perhaps?). But the good news is that through consistent, focussed effort, you will narrow down and determine what works for you and what doesn't, to even get to the point where you are even sleepoing better than your friends and family! What have you tried? Who else do you feel comfortable asking for help? Have you had blood tests from the Dr / sleep study? Is your room cleaned regularly, and aerated at least twice a day? Does it have a funny smell? Have you visited a good Acupuncturist? (Might be a spleen energy deficiency - common cause of constant tiredness). What self-help books have you read? Now is the time to push, marshall your friends and family for help, don't feel bad to ask because at the very least once you've improved your sleep you can inspire other sufferers. Get it? YOU must get the ball rolling, the sooner the better. The change might not occur immediately, but it will, I promise. One thing in life to keep in mind is that \"all things shall pass\". So please, don't let it stresss you, look it in the face and tackle it!!", "hash": "19ebcfec2a5adc52570f9a6cf691c602b6dc4a7f6ba2845a50379729b687010e"}

After my psychological symptoms had become controlled, my urinary symptoms began to increase. I began to not only experience urinary frequency during the day, but also the need to wake up 1-2 times a night 4x per week. At the age of 24, my meds were: lexapro, buspar, and klonopin rather than ativan. At this point, waking up 1-2x per night was the norm and I began to suffer from nocturnal enuresis on a nightly basis. Soon after, around age 25, I was not only incontinent during the night, but began to become incontinent during the day, as well as waking up 5-8x per night to urinate. I have been to 8 urologists (2 of which were “wasted” appts given their unrelated urological specialties that I was not made aware of, along with extra charges that were too much to pay) 1 neurologist, and 2 endocrinologists who ruled out diabetes mellitus and insipidous along with other potential endocrine issues. They were not convinced that the lithium created a lasting effect either. I have not seen a nephrologist. BPH and OAB meds. Tests: scopes, urodynamics, ultrasounds, cultures, labs, MRI. Intervention: interstim. 1 urologist detected a stricture, another did not. The second urologist did point out my prostate was not that of a 28 year old, but not “wonky” enough to deem it a problem for now. There are no urinary pills, or class of pills, to be revisited.

Since last year i've been taking a shower before going to bed which used to put me to sleep almost instantly when my head hit the pillow. Eventually I found a delay before falling asleep which inturn caused me to resort to eating before going to bed. This used to put me to sleep instantly, however howadays I realize that it's putting a damper on my ability to sleep. Night Eating Syndrome. As a result I find myself getting up multiple times throughout the night. Until recently, when I got up, my brain was on auto polit to get something to eat. In the last couple of days i've been taking lurasidone. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lurasidone An anti anxiety medication that does help prevent me from eating, but sadly I have reason to believe it prevents me from sleeping. The first day I took it, I was unable to sleep the night before. Despite this it took several hours to for me to fall asleep, despite it surpressing my hunger. The second night I was unable to fall asleep until 6 am. The third night produced the same result as the first mainly because I couldn't sleep the previous night. I'm worried that i'm going to be facing a new pattern where I can't sleep the first night, but eventually sleep the second and that this pattern may get worse. I have reason to believe that while the Lurasidone curbs my apitite, it does not curb my need to eat in order to sleep. In addition to Lurasidone, I also take Trazodone(aka Asenapine) at 1 and a half tablets, Saphris at 5mg, and one or two pills of serenity formula. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trazodone https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asenapine I've heard that sleeping pills can worsen night eating syndrome and starting yesterday, I stopped taking them. http://journals.lww.com/neurotodayonlin ... e=fulltext I've ordered a bottle of Serotonin brainn food since i've heard that lack of Serotonin causes Night Eating Syndrome. I don't know how this could effect my meds however. I take my Lurasidone at 7:00. 3 and half hours before going to bed. I also take Trazodone at 9:30 and Saphris at 10:30. I used to take a shower before going to bed, but as time went on I stopped as i'm worried that it's been causing me problems. I'm worried that my sleeping is going to get worse as time goes on as it always has since last year. I'm hoping that there is surgery or a brain implant that I could buy to help me out or if I could get a surgery operation to further examine my head, but I need more information. One of the problems i'm facing is that no one is telling me anything useful. My mother, despite knowing my plight, doesn't understand the weight of what i'm going through. It may help to know if there are support groups I could join. Any advice? Please help. I'm worried that my sleeping issues are going to get worse and without help I may eventually lose my ability to sleep. Notes: 1.I for some reason have an obsession with going to the bathroom at night even when there's only a few drops of urine in my body. 2.I believe that my nose my need surgery to breath properly as i've dug too far into my nose. 3.I'm unsure about the effects of my combined medicine and the side effects they come with. 4.Since taking my lurasidone, i've had 2 pieces of bread before bed to help stave off my hunger. 5.Songs get stuck in my head at night every two or three nights.

The second thing I could try to recommend to you is possibly eating something healthier than bread before you go to sleep, like maybe an apple or a banana.

I apologise for what seems to've become a very long thread - I tried to stick to the most relevant details. For about a year and a half I've been suffering from a specific type of sleep problem. The last part of my sleep, towards the morning (perhaps the final hour or so; hard to tell exactly) is very agitated; feels like a dizziness, as if I had mud in my head, and where I am half-awake (almost conscious/obsessive dream-like thoughts reoccur) yet find it difficult to wake up. This means that, after a struggle to break away from a confusing, exhausting last hour of sleep, not only will I have spent longer in bed than I'd have wished (say, 9 hours) but \"in exchange\" I get a day during which I am often tired, and sometimes find it hard to stay awake longer than 10pm. \"Tricking\" myself out of sleep before the critical stage starts (e.g. after 7 hours of sleep) doesn't work, as then I just feel under-slept. Other (even more upsetting) side-effects of this long-standing sleep disorder include irritablility and apathy to exercise and to sex. In addition, I seem to've acquired a form of tinitus (high-pitched buzz in both ears), the severity (loudness) of which varies from day to day, though hard to tell if correlated with sleep quality. Several medical tests (including ear-nose-throat, endocrinology and head MR-imaging) revealed no obvious cause underlying my symptoms, however a sleep study (polysomnography) revealed two presumtive (tentatively-given) diagnoses: 1) REM sleep disorder (although I don't have the intense dreams characteristic of this diagnostic) 2) borderline sleep apnea (several episodes of irregular breathing per night). After this test, my somnologist prescribed Circadin 2mg (melatonin), which I've been taking for a month now without any noticeable improvements even after being told to double the dosage; the medic recommended, if the Circadin treatment remains ineffective till the end, that I next try to sleep with an anti-apneic mask (CPAP). If that will fail also, she said the only remaining cause remains stress; I haven't been particularly stressed times, however I *do* tend to take things to heart. Some further details: - Taking natural sleep supplements (camomile tea, pills with lavander, etc) before bedtime helps sometimes but not reliably (probably not beyond placebo) - My sleep is abnormally dependent upon bed-time, in that if I go to bed late (a lot later than, say, midnight) I am guaranteed a tormented sleep. However, even going to bed early (11pm) hardly helps with the final-hour-restlessness that I describe. - I'm keeping careful sleep logs, however none of the factors I suspected - including amount of exercise (which I don't do enough of) and stress during the previous day, bed/pillow conditions, bed time, anything to do with meals (including coffee), etc - don't seem to obviously (and single-handedly) lead to this final-hour-syndrome - Soon after falling asleep, I am told I often fidget/twitch and snore, although I never have trouble *falling* asleep (only at the waking-up end) - Since 1.5 years ago when my problems started, the frequency with which my sleep ends with such a restless hour varies: I've had a few good months/weeks, but otherwise it's rare (maybe one night out of 10) that I *don't* get the symptom, i.e. when I wake up easily and rested. - My sleep hours are normally regular (midnight to 8am) I am male, mid 30s, no other major health problems. If anyone has encountered similar symptoms and can share any advice of what they tried that worked, I'd be really grateful!

I haven't officially got diagnosed with it, actually misdiagnosed and prescribed a sleeping pill that just made it worse. But i know that i have this disorder because no matter what I do, I can't sleep at night and only be able to sleep throughout the day. At the time of this writing, it's 12:33 PM and I feel so active and refreshed. I won't be able to get sleep before 3:00 or 4:00 AM since i woke up at 3:00 pm today. I also have anxiety disorder for which I'm taking escitalopram for the past 3 years. I have to get up early in the morning to take the university classes and when I wake up in the morning, I feel terrible and experience severe anxiety because of not getting enough sleep at night. I feel like a zombie until afternoon. I've tried not sleeping at all the whole night and then forcing myself to stay up for the rest of the day in order to sleep at a reasonable time at night for example 9:00 PM. But after coming back home, my body says \"Hey, it's time to awake\" and I don't feel tired to sleep early. I can stay up and do the work even If I'm up since 18 hours! Or even if I can manage to sleep at 10:00 PM, what will happen is that I will sleep WAY too much, for example 14 hours and wake up at 12:00 PM. The next day, obviously since I have woke up at 12:00 PM, I won't be able to sleep at 10:00 PM and this goes on and on, every single day. No matter what I do, I can probably maintain the routine for 2-3 days but eventually i get back to my same routine. Sleep at day, Wake up at night. On Saturday night, I was able to sleep by 1:00 AM but I woke up at 3:00 PM (Over 14 hours). And since I woke up at 3:00 PM, I won't be able to sleep at 1:00 AM today. So basically, my sleep is delayed 2-3 hours every day because of sleeping too much. I usually sleep 12-14 hours a day. So basically, I have 2 problems: 1.) Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome 2.) Sleeping too much (12-14 hours) daily. I don't know why my body requires me to sleep too much. I also have terrible constipation most of the time so that may be reason why I'm sleeping so much. I can probably get rid of this disorder if I can wake up after 7-8 hours of sleep. Does anyone here experienced the same thing? I would love to hear from people who are like me and going through the same thing and possibly a solution to fix this problem. I got poor grades because of this disorder since I just can't concentrate in the morning classes. Thanks, Usman.", "hash": "3233bcb3de1b08415a527a19b75627aa6064c809bd7bf5f29832dbb0cea4deb5"}

I loathed school nights. We used to joke about it all years later but the truth is, as a 29yr old, I still have the same problem. Unless I have an appointment or have to be somewhere for like 8am, I can't wake up until 10am or later. It seems if I wake at 11am I won't feel tired until 2 or 3am. I will set numerous alarms for half 6 but when they sound, I'll be like ***k that, turn them off and wake up at noon furious with myself. I work 4 till 11pm so I am pretty much able to follow my own sleep pattern. Don't get me wrong if I was offered 50 bucks to haul ass out of bed at 6am I could but I hate the groggy feeling that lasts for about an hour.

I'm not quite sure what I'm looking for in making this post, or even whether it's the correct forum for what I describe, but I hope it doesn't cause any problems! For many years - longer than I can remember - I haven't slept the full 8 hours. Also, perhaps coincidentally, for the last 20 years, I have been working shifts at work intermittently. I started off 20 years ago working mornings (6 - 2) and afternoons (2 - 10) and did that for about 7 years. But for the last 8 years I have worked a 3-shift system that has included mornings, afternoons and nights (10pm - 6am) on a rotating 3-week cycle. I find that when I'm on morning shift, I only sleep for a few hours and wake up very early - a lot earlier than I need to, even though I have an alarm clock. When I'm on afternoons, I can go to bed after midnight, and still wake up any time between 5 and 7am, and only sleep intermittently from then onwards. On nights, I get to bed about 6:30am, and it's unheard of for me to sleep past 11:30, often waking a lot earlier. Even when I'm not working, I can go to bed just after midnight and wake up early, only sleeping fitfully after. As you can imagine, this often leaves me feeling sleepy during the day. Sometimes i can be watching TV in the afternoon and go to sleep. I have often felt sleepy when driving home after a night shift, but that's not really surprising as I've had a night without sleep. I mentioned it in passing to a medical professional and, perhaps partly because I'm also overweight, I'm being referred to check for sleep apnea. SO it is being investigated. Does anybody else have similar problems sleeping? My own feeling about this is that it could just as easily be due to shift work rather than any other medical cause, but it's best to exclude something more serious.", "hash": "dbd1ea20f674facc6b4cfc797ecaa1011fe7762e82ce9bc4cca69b3cd8d9351f"}

Weird experiences by mrcrowley » Sat Jun 25, 2016 3:03 pm Hi all, new here. I found this place while trying to find any information about my experiences. I'll try and keep it pretty short but I'm afraid it could be a long read. Anyway; I started having sleep paralysis experiences about 7 years ago. At first I was scared of it, like everybody - until I read about it and it calmed me. But then it started to happen on a regular basis. I had it 3-4 times a week the next few years, but I learned to control it. Controlling it by not opening my eyes (in fear of hallucinations) and doing my best to wake up. But - as I met a few friends who had the same experiences, they also started talking about Lucid dreams. I thought it sounded cool and wanted to try it. But now I understand that what I have been experiencing a few times the last year or so isn't lucid dreaming. More like a mix between sleep paralysis, lucid dreaming and OBE. Most often, I just try to wake up from the paralysis (Still get them a few times a week) but sometimes, when I'm feeling adventurous, I take it step further: I use all the energy in my body to try and raise myself from bed. Mostly I can't do it, but a few times I've been able to get up and walk around in my apartment for 20-30 seconds up to a minute before I wake up. I can't really do anything. I'm trying to fly or go to other places and such but without any results. But today I managed to do more than that. It felt like I stayed in this for an hour. I was having a sleep paralysis, managed to get up, walk around my apartment (noticing an extra lamp and a chair which reminded me of it not being real), and I tried to go piss, watch porn and other stuff to see how it was like. It was very intense and I controlled everything. I can't do anything else than I would be able to do with \"physical\" me. That is, I can´t hover, fly, do backflips or anything. And I can't take myself to another place unless I walk there. So I'm trapped in my apartment. But I am in TOTAL control of what I'm doing. - Which is the interesting part here when I talk to friends who has Lucid dreams. Not a basic dream. This is something completely else and always origins from the sleep paralysis. Eventually I started freaking out so I decided to wake up. And now I'm sitting here with a pool of sweat in my bed, having a little trouble talking (like I was drunk or something) and I feel physically drained. What is happening? What is this all about?

I've healed past all this but I was just wondering what this might mean. I also seemed to experience something like hypnogogic hallucinations before sleeping after having a dense baseball bat type log broken over the front of my head which also lead to various masochistic and antisocial behaviors later on and diminished emotional spectrum.

About once a week, force yourself to stay awake all night and all day the next day. This will make you tired enough to be able to sleep at a decent time the next night, such as 9-10-11 pm. Be sure not too fall asleep too late or early. This will reset your circadian rhythm and it'll be easier to fall asleep earlier. It may lead to slight sleep deprivation, but as long as you get a good night's rest on the nights when you do sleep, it shouldn't cause adverse health affects. Just be sure not to drive or operate machinery when you haven't slept. This may not be for you, but I hope you can at least try it.

I'd like to ask the people on here, though-- is this a problem that's been haunting you most your life? Because for me, it has been- though of course, not to the same extremes as recently. My mom says that even when I was a baby I wouldn't sleep- they took me to doctors and labeled it as DSPD, the more accurate technical term being an \"altered cicadian rhythm.\" It just sort of means that your biological clock is different from most people's. Not just a night-owl. I physically have trouble trying to sleep before a minimum of two am (usually three or four). I've tried everything- skipping days of sleeping in order to make myself more tired and hopefully sleep sooner- which always manages to backfire somehow. Getting on a very strict diet where you eat specific things at specific times. Lying in the dark, waiting to fall asleep. Doing something to tire me in order to sleep (gym is kind of helpful there, but it's never enough, because only my body tires). It's absolutely ridiculous, and it keeps me from doing a lot of things. Family doesn't understand it at all. There's actually two types of altered cicadian rhythms which are the basics of DSPD. The first is just sort of a traditional, shifted sleep schedule. You still need the same amount of sleep as any normal person might, but your hours of functionality are vastly different. Up late, sleep late. The other one is not merely a shifted rhythm but it is a lengthened one as well. Typically described as operating on the schedule of a 25-hour day, it means that you don't just go to bed late, but you go to bed late-r, and you need more sleep. Because you have this weird extra hour, your schedule constantly shifts between needing more time at night and in the mornings. I've recently read though that this can be affected with light therapy (sounds hokey, but stay with me here). I don't remember precisely what the light is called, but having a certain type of light on in the mornings can help slowly adjust your schedule, perhaps not to normal, but operable times. Just try google searching light therapy in relation to DSPD or cicadian rhythms- you should get something. Anyways, I'm willing to try it, and figured it might be worth something to somebody to share.", "hash": "5adcbd6ac292ec4cba7e91bacf88f357ac5b9d5ea416e1745797ce3d8189e566"}

I usually go to sleep after midnight (somewhere around 2 or 3AM) and have to wake up every morning at 6AM to get ready for school. I have many alarms set on my phone, each one 5 minutes after the other, since one alarm never wakes me up anymore. Turns out that this actually is a terrible mistake, since my brain knows that even if I turn off the first alarm, I can go back to sleep and maybe the following alarm would wake me up. But it doesn't, since I just open my eyes to turn off the next alarm and go back to sleep. My parents bought me a vintage alarm clock, which is right abore my head and whenever the alarm rings, it's just so loud that even the heaviest sleeper would wake up. The good thing is that once it starts ringing, it can't be turned off. But lately, I've gotten used to that as well and it doesn't seem to wake me up anymore. Instead, I have to have my mother struggle to wake me up, as I am often abusive and violent in the waking process, which strangely I cannot control, nor remember after fully waking up. This also has to do with my DID as well, which makes it really difficult for my mother. She has said many times that she's quite stressed and scared of me in the mornings, not knowing how I'll react, as most times I end up injuring her. This morning I left bruises on her arms, while I was in the stage between sleep and waking. I don't remember much of it, besides the part where I felt I was in dream land, dreaming about myself being a kung fu master or some sort. It may seem funny, but it's really not. I never wanted to injure my mother like that, but I can't really help it. However, there is one method of waking up that most of the time works on me. And that is when my mother turns on the TV and sets the volume high. Now, since I don't use my TV for anything, other than to connect it to my laptop and watch movies on the big screen, hearing a cooking show or something I don't ever watch is just really bugging me in a way, so I'd have to get up to turn the TV off. I've come to the conclusion that sounds that really annoy you and, of course, sounds that are loud enough for you to hear them through your dream, could wake you up easily. But as the person above me has said, these sounds should be on the other end of your room, in order for you to get up and walk that distance to turn it off. I've realized that I wake up faster when I'm sleeping on places where the windows are right next to my bed. It's difficult for me to wake up when I'm sleeping in my own room, since my bed is away from the windows, but if your bed is close to them, you can try to sleep with the windows opened, so the sun light and the possible car or bird sounds or any morning sounds coming from your window could wake you up easily. ❝If BJD dolls can be perfect, then so can I.❞ - Personal. ☽♡☾", "hash": "a386237f03bcc69e9f263f24907c38f514b3656cd863ce26547a914f4c26307f"}

Recently I found a solution and it works very well for me. Hope it help others . see below for instructions First I make sure there is no sleep debt, I make sure I had enough sleep for 2-3 days then on day 4 I don't sleep at usual time (say 6 am) and I try to stay up as long as I can, then around 1 pm I really feel I can't stay up anymore so I go to bed and set multiple alarm clocks at 4 pm ( sleep only 3 hours) it's hard to get up but with multiple alaram clocks finally I get up. I wash my face and drink a cup of tea or eat something. this makes me to wake up and feel fresh. then I do my usual activities (mostly programming) then around 8 pm I fell I really need sleep so I go to bed and set alarm clock at 8:20 (sleep 20 min) then I hardly get up and after washing my face and eating something I feel fresh. I need this 20 min sleep again at around 1 am and I sleep at 1 am then get up 1:20 am. and finally I sleep at 6:0 am for 6 hours and get up at 12:0 pm. from now on I need 20 min sleep around 5 pm and another 20 min sleep around 12 am (mid night) then I sleep at 6:0 am for 6 hours. please note now getting up is much easier specially after 20 min sleep. I have to mention I never couldn't sleep less than 8 hours and sleeping less than 8 hours cause sleep debts. but this way I can sleep 6.5 hours a day without feeling tired, also It's easy to sleep at same time every day, I easily fall asleep at 6:0 am every day. There is only 2 negative points with this solution. 1.starting it is a bit hard 2.If for any reason I can't get my 20 min sleep during evening and during midnight then I can't continue this method anymore and my sleep cycle changes badly. (unfortunately I have this problem with two kids, some times I can't sleep when I need it, longest time I could use this pattern was for 2 weeks and finally my wife asks my to do something in the evening or midnight so I can't get that 20 min sleep and ...)

I will be as thorough as possible in my description of what is going on so this will be a long read. I have only had long term relationships and during periods of being single I was never keen on sleeping with random people so I always keep to myself while single. Recently I have been talking to a girl I find myself quite interested in but neither of is are looking for a relationship. I can tell she is a good girl and similar to me in regards to not sleeping around and things were going just fine. We hung out a few times and ended up becoming intimate one night, and have spent the night together a few times since then but nothing more has happened. I'm not really looking for a \"sexual thing\" so that's fine by me that nothing more has happened, but recently she started acting weird and I picked up on it so I started trying to gauge what was going on. I'll save you the story there, but I was certainly on to something and what I was told has me experiencing a wide range of constantly varying emotions, needless to say none of them are good. She explained to me that the other night when her and I had been drinking that after we went to sleep she woke up to me \"fondling her\" in her sleep. I have absolutely no recollection of this happening at all, but certainly am not surprised to hear her telling me this. I will give some back story on my past and then come back to this. I have only had two really serious girlfriends that I shared a bed with in the past. One of them was more reserved when it came to sex and the other very open. With the girl who was very open we would often times end up having sex in the middle of the night. Most times I was completely unaware of what was happening until we were already in the act, while she claims I was the one who instigated it. She had no problem with my midnight roaming hands and actually loved it. Fast fwd to the next girl, she was a sexual girl, but loooooooooved her sleep. There was no middle of the night sex. Ever. Just wasn't her thing. There were many nights I would wake up to her slapping my hands off of her, either between her legs or groping her chest (I'm assuming with the girl before this was what \"initiated\" things). I would never have a clear recollection of it and it always seemed like a dream more than anything else and sometimes I would ask her the next day if it happened and she would laugh and confirm it wasn't a dream. My behaviors included groping, kissing the back of her neck and fondling her breasts, as well as dirty talk, but any time it would happen I would be pushed away and would \"instantly return to sleep\" according to her. On multiple occasions she says she tried to wake me up afterwards because she thought I was faking it but quickly realized I really was asleep and wasn't bothered by it aside from the sleep interruption. I never really thought much of this as she was my girlfriend and she knew that if it became a bother just to push me away. I just chalked it up to me being a highly sexual person and my sleeping self was no different than my awake self. Were all human right? Who doesn't like sex? I decided to stop masturbating in December (I felt porn had an unhealthy impact on the way I viewed women and relationships) so I have certainly been highly arousable but have only had one sexual encounter (with the current girl I was talking to) since the last time I masturbated, so being around this new girl (who is a knockout btw) definitely excites me (in more than just an intellectual way). I noticed that in the past with my last girlfriend my sleep hands would be much more adventurous when we weren't having sex often, so I am not surprised that this would happen given the \"drought\" I have created for myself by no fap. So back to the current situation. I am pretty sure that there isn't going to be much of a chance at salvaging things with this current girl I have been talking to, but I feel she is looking at me like a f@&king rapist now, and I really respected this girl and valued her friendship. At the very least I would like to part ways without her thinking I am some sicko that likes to fondle girls while they are wasted in their sleep. I would never do something like that consciously. I would never do something like that. Ever. How do I explain this to her? Am I some demented pervert that needs to be locked away in a cage? Furthermore I feel sick to my stomach because I can only imagine what she is thinking about me, and for some reason I really do care to clear the air with her and explain this to her so she understands I wasn't tying to violate her. Ugh I feel like I'm going to puke. Last edited by Remember Ronni on Mon May 19, 2014 9:49 am, edited 1 time in total.

It might help her to understand that you were not necessarily to blame (on a conscious level anyway) for your attentions. You might also mention your previous encounters. The fact that one enjoyed it while one repulsed it means that she can take initiative to prevent matters if she feels inclined.

If you can, really listen to her and let her say everything she needs, without taking it personally. She has the right to feel how she feels about the situation, up to and including feeling like she was raped . This doesn't mean you're a bad person, it just means we don't get to say what the other person's experience was, even if we're unintentional about it. This includes yourself by the way - if you feel sick and angry then that's how you feel, so stay with that and explore those feelings, figure out why you feel that way, and any other things you feel too, like other commentors have suggested I think exploring your sexual desires and being REALLY honest about that is key here too. Make sure you figure out which parts are appropriate to share with her and which parts might hurt her when she's already feeling really vulnerable. I'd like to challenge you on something too - I'm actually going through a similar situation myself. My boyfriend masturbates in his sleep, once even to the point of ejaculating without waking up, and for multiple reasons of things in my past, that is REALLY triggering for me. I'm working through a lot of stuff around that, but when it comes to him, I feel REALLY betrayed for him not telling me before we moved in together. (yes, we'd slept together multiple times before, but always to have sex, which basically made it not happen or have him involve me the moment I was even stirring, and he was awake which made it ok, not to mention I was usually having to leave sometime in the night before it would start happening anyway) We unfortunately live in a society where most people have some kind of trauma around sexuality, especially women. To not mention this kind of thing and ask \"are you going to be ok with that if it happens?\" is HIGHLY irresponsible, especially if you're aware you might actually touch HER body without being able to ask for consent. Because subconscious or not, intention or not, you touched her without her consent. That's a big deal, and it's going to take some work to unravel. I'd definitely suggest sleeping separately for now until you get this figured out. It sounds like you and this girl are pretty sweet on each other, and you sound like an emotionally mature guy, so you should be able to at least work through this and remain friends if that's what needs to happen. Do be aware that it may take her months of sorting through this in her own head to fully process it, and she may need to come back to this conversation multiple times. Please always take her very seriously (remember, this isn't about you, it doesn't make you a bad person, but she does need to be acknowledged for her own experiences) always respect her, and give her space for the option to change her mind - women live in this \"rape culture\" where the victim is either blamed or denied, so she may not even be able to articulate that something's wrong yet. It may take you coming up to her and saying \"I feel sick about this... how are you feeling?\" for her to even be able to admit that something wrong happened. I'm sure you're up for the challenge, and if this can be a learning experience for the both of you, I believe it will actually help our society a lot in the long run. One more thing, it might be helpful to ask her what her boundaries on the matter are. Like \"what are you ok with and not ok with sleeping next to someone in the future?\" she may also have repressed memories of when she felt similar things before that she might now be having to face, complicating things. I know I do from my experiences! Best of luck.", "hash": "139767fc8235cf0c6b974aa914a606fa2e6b45430c2c8bd44c4f61069789b9f1"}

Have those been addressed? If not, check out Katy Bowman's work and her aligned and well videos or program.

My sleep problems are slowly getting worse. I have no difficulty getting off to sleep, often suffering auditory hypnogognia. I also suffer auditory hypnogognia while I am sleeping, with my name being called as if I have over slept. I regularly get up at 6am for work, but this is getting earlier and earlier, 3am to 4am being the norm. It doesn't seem to matter what I do exercise wise, since effective sleep eludes me. If I go to sleep at 8:30pm, I am up at 11pm, then 1am, then 4am, 4:30am, 5am, etc. I usually experience dreams (nightmares 60-70% of the time) prior to 11pm or after 4am. If I am lucky I will knock off Saturday night and manage to sleep through from say 10pm tip 4am. Currently I work 6 days a week and train 3 times a week.

Anyway I have a lot of fears such as losing control of my mind. When I wake this panicked state I feel like I'm crazy or about to detach from reality. My mind races and it's like I'm still dreaming and having a panic attack at the same time. My heart races, my eyes can't focus, I'm irritable and confused and scared over something I'm not really sure what of. I have a fear of aliens and when I wake in the panic I get scared that an alien is gonna come in my house and take me. A million things go around head and it takes about 15 minutes to calm down and come around before I can go back to sleep. The next day I wake up feeling fine. Is this a panic attack in my sleep?

So perhaps find a level of light that is just enough for you not to be scared, and then try to reduce it by just a tiny bit every week or so? Another thing that comes to mind -- have you tried any sleeping aids? Melatonin is available OTC, and 1 mg is enough; take it an hour before your desired sleep time. Big hugs.

I can see why this is a problem. Myself, I can fall asleep without issue, but I haven't had a good nights rest in years. This is a basic sleep hygiene issue and can be resolved hopefully easily. Basic tips: no computer or TV within an hour of bed. No snacks, no caffeine after 5pm, and no alcohol before bed! This should help with a few things. Now, you say you're a student, first time living away from home? How is your diet? Going to sleep hungry can cause issues falling asleep, so make sure you have a decent dinner. Oliveira was very much on the right track with the larger issue. Light plays a huge role in our sleep/wake cycle. If you're sleeping with the light on, your body isn't producing melatonin, it's producing serotonin. The amount of light needs to be decreased ASAP at night, and make sure you get true direct sunlight in the morning, no sunglasses. The main thing to focus on is your fear of the dark, because that anxiety coupled with the anxiety of not sleeping, coupled with stress from school is going to keep you up. I'd recommend some l-tryptophan, once in the morning, and once at night without light, or at least, very, very dim. This will increase your melatonin at night, helping you to sleep, but in the day, it will become serotonin, to help with wakefulness and anxiety. Hope this helps", "hash": "fa36d885f09aa1eb8160e9105f56d977fffcd180e4fde140319b593b6195b5fb"}

Sorry you didn't get many responses. One thing that comes to my mind is melatonin. It's a hormone that regulates your circadian rhythm -- normally it should be at its highest level between midnight and 8am. You can buy OTC melatonin supplements and try that for a while. They sell really high dosages but 1-2 mg will be plenty. There is also a possibility you have a disorder the name of which handily escapes me which basically means that your sleeping rhythm is different from that of general population. (If you look through other people's posts it's been mentioned.) And finally, you might go to your doctor and request a *SHORT TERM* sleeping aid. Take it for a week or two (not more, ideally) around 11 and go to bed. I have used a few, and can recommend (es)zopiclone or diazepam/valium. Ambien is very popular but since it made me sleep-e-mail, sleep-purchase-things-from-Amazon and finally sleep-walk-into-a-metal-chair, injure myself and ruin the chair, I personally wouldn't recommend that one. However, of course, your mileage may vary. You don't mention what sort of anti-psychotics you used. Seroquel (quetiapine) in very low doses, like 25mg, can also serve as a sleeping aid. If you've used that for a long time during daytime, your circadian rhythm might be out of whack indeed. So if melatonin doesn't do the trick I'd recommend you see a doctor about your sleep problem. Hugs -- I hope you catch some zzzs soon! Currently working on my upcoming signature.", "hash": "59c5e15d60edc79c82f4562c88a21e5860340c348705b55826285f80dd991435"}

I couldn't find help as to why recently I've taken up an odd sleep position lately. Nor can I find any mention of anyone actually sleeping like my husband has been recently finding me. I start off sleeping normally on my side. I sleep on either side and usually alternate. I seem to be having a lot of neck pain and shoulder pain as of late and mentioned it to my husband. He told me he's caught me at least 4 times recently sleeping in a sort of \"plank\" position. Apparently, I settle my weight on my forearms, head hanging towards the bed. My head just hanging there. Doesn't that sound weird to anyone else? I've never heard of anyone sleeping like that. I've added an image to help you visualize how I am sleeping, The difference with this picture is that of course my abs are contracting so my lower body apparently is lying flat and it's just my chest and head that are the odd one's out.

My whole life I've described myself as a 'morning person' and generally wake up around 8 am on my own. I'm in a new dorm room at college and my side of the room gets zero natural light - what comes through shines on the door, not on my living space. Mostly my roommate keeps the blinds halfway down and the divider between our sides shut, though. Since I moved in, I've been having more and more trouble with my sleeping patterns. I can't fall asleep until 2-4 am, no matter what I do - total darkness and for hours, but no sleep. Then I can't wake up until 11am-1pm, no matter how many alarms I set. One morning, I set 10 separate alarms and slept through them all (my roommate told me). Ocassionally, I wake up for a minute to hit snooze, but then I fall asleep sitting up. I read about Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder, and it's the only thing I've found that fits, but is it possible to experience this, or something like it, temporarily due to light deprivation? I feel so helpless, like it doesn't matter what I try, and I've never been like this before. I'm failing classes for the first time in my life because I can't wake up. More importantly, if I can start sleeping next to a window again (for normal light cycles), will I go back to normal? p.s I know that I need to seek professional help as well, but as I understand it, diagnosis can take a while and there aren't any specialists near me - I need help NOW, please", "hash": "01a8455c3f9d680eb2c8ebbd4923af99ca6ea9d89594ef98a0210b1f6fa90145"}

Last night something horrible happened, and i'm going to try my best to describe it. After a day of drunkenness (about six beers) I fell asleep at maybe 10 or so. I remember having some problems getting to sleep and staying asleep, but I was eventually able to. I remember it was probably 2 AM or so, when I \"woke up\" to find things not quite right. There was a weird feeling in my chest and head, kind of like waves going through me, or a pressure. I had fallen asleep with a movie on my laptop (Spirited Away) but I remember specifically seeing \" The Ring \" playing on my laptop when I \"woke up\" (I never watched The Ring at all last night) but it appeared that it was the little creepy girl from The Ring on my screen, in a scene that is really in the movie. I don't remember much else besides a feeling of WANTING and NEEDING to wake my boyfriend up. I wanted to shake him and wake him up, because I was SURE I was dying and I wanted him to call an ambulance. But I couldn't. It was like a hundred pound weight was on me, and I was TERRIFIED. Finally (I can't remember how much time had passed) I was able to get myself out of bed slowly (this really happened, I think I was able to pull myself out of whatever was happening) and I quickly went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror. My eyes were BLOODSHOT red, very red. and I got a washcloth and put hot water on it and put it on my face. I just remember being terrified ever since I woke up and for about the next 2 hours. So terrified I could not get back to sleep. I didn't want it to happen again. So I stayed up until about 4 and was finally able to get to sleep. I can't really describe how horrible I felt, it was just a feeling of dread the entire time. I don't really know what to think. I know that I kept waking up constantly after that, I couldn't sleep for very long. I've also been having bad nightmares as well. My boyfriend basically doesn't believe me and thinks i'm just crazy - which is insulting to me because it dismisses everything that I felt last night as something that i'm making up. Am I really crazy? Does this sound similar to anyone's experiences with Sleep Paralysis?", "hash": "493583d143849bf94b398bd65670d6728b7efd3dcd478f3d3e043a49d72317fb"}

When I had just started at university I had an episode of sleep paralysis which was nothing unusual. My student accommodation was in a Victorian terrace house. In this episode I was paralysised in bed and I was looking over toward the wall. I got the usual fear of foreboding doom and sure enough a white ghostly figure appeared and floated toward me. As it got closer the noise in my head got louder (not sure if increased heart beat through fear causes this). The \"ghost\" stood at the side of the bed and pointed towards my alarm clock. For some reason I didn't want it to get to the alarm clock. I think I knew the alarm would soon be going off and would wake me out of the sleep paralysis. I managed to wriggle my little finger and this brought me out. I looked at the alarm clock to find out it had stopped! It was only battery operated, but even when I replaced the batteries the clock wouldn't work. Was that co-incidence or something a bit weird?

I feel like it's a sleep disorder because it has gotten to the point where it is a problem and affecting my life. When I was younger, I would experience sleep paralysis once every couple of months, and over the last few years it has gotten worse, and now I experience it multiple times a night. I've read that it usually happens when people are waking up, but with me it's always before I even fall asleep. I will lay down in my bed, and close my eyes, and try to sleep, and usually after a few minutes of laying there with my eyes closed,still awake and aware of my surroundings, I will get that feeling like I'm falling, and then I will just be stuck there in sleep paralysis, still aware of my surroundings, but unable to move. I do all the tricks to try and wake up, like wiggling my toes, or fingers, and just going with it and trying to relax, but it never works. Honestly it's confusing because it doesn't feel like I've fallen asleep at all in the first place. If I manage to relax, or move a limb, instead of waking up, I just experience falling and the paralysis all over again. The falling part usually lasts what feels like a few minutes, and causes a loud rushing sound, and makes it hard to concentrate on anything else, and once it stops, I become aware again of the fact that I can't move. This happens on a cycle over and over until I don't even know how much time has passed, and I'm just so exhausted that I can't even fight it anymore, I just lay there and let myself be paralysed and let myself feel like I'm falling. It's gotten to the point where trying to go to sleep has become very stressful. And because I go through the cycle of my paralysis and trying to wake up repeatedly so many times a night, by the time I do fall asleep, it's so hard to get up. If I don't have an alarm set in the morning, I will sleep for 12 hours, minimum, and nothing wakes me up. I don't understand whats happening. Or what to do about it.

(I have 'suspected' BPD and currently awaiting treatment.) Last night, I believe I experienced 'sleep paralysis'. I had lots of crazy dreams last night, some traumatic. When this happened I was on the verge of waking up, sort of half asleep half awake. I can't remember what I was dreaming prior to it happening but I know it was something very dark. I found myself completely paralyzed. I remember feeling like something/someone was inside of me. I couldn't move a muscle, felt like I could hardly breathe and I couldn't talk. I was desperately trying to scream or talk but all that came out was this strange sound like a silent growl, the kind you see in movies when someone is getting possessed but just air coming out, no vocal whatsoever it just wouldn't work. It was truly horrifying and traumatic. My body just would not move. I tried as hard as I could for a long time. I felt like I was trying to use absolutely every ounce of energy in my body. This went on for a while and eventually I woke up. I have experienced dreams in the past where I'm trying to scream and nothing comes out, or I'm trying to run but my legs won't go, but this was just total and complete paralysis and I was semi conscious. After searching a little today I found out it is called sleep paralysis. Have any of you experienced it before? If so did it ever reoccur?

The only way I can describe it is dreaming while I'm awake. It happens every night; I can see that I'm in my bed, yet my brain seems to think I'm somewhere else -- doing other things. I will use my sheets and pillows as if they're other items. I can see while this is happening that they are clearly just sheets and pillows but this doesn't snap me out of it. There are always other people involved in these \"dreams\" but I don't see them while my eyes are open; all I can see is my bedroom as it is, nothing abnormal -- no actual hallucinations. Usually I'll just sit up in my bed while this is happening, but there are times where I'll get out of my bed and walk around. The most common occurrence of this is me being \"kicked out\" of my bed because I'll think that I'm not actually in my room (yet I can see that I am). These \"dreams\" are never of a positive nature. There's always some type of conflict or I'll have anxiety about whatever is happening. The most recent reoccurring theme (lasted about 5 nights) was of me and my friend driving through the mountains. Either my brakes weren't working properly or something else was going wrong. I'd just be sitting up in my bed looking around, seeing clearing that I was in my room, but believing I was driving. I can't say how long these episodes last. I'm guessing anywhere between 2-10 minutes. It ends by me just laying back down and closing my eyes. I never actually \"snap out of it\" and realize that I'm just dreaming, I kind of just go back to sleep. It's hard to say what actually happens at that point. I'm pretty sure It only happens once per night, but I could be wrong -- I could be having several small episodes spread out throughout the night and just be remembering it as one single episode. I don't know. That's pretty much it. I've tried melatonin but that doesn't help. The only time it doesn't happen is if I'm sleeping somewhere else, such as a friends house or on a trip somewhere. As soon as I get back home, it happens again. I've tried switching rooms but to no avail. Every morning I wake up feeling extremely tired so it's definitely effecting my sleep in some way.

I think I've had unrefreshing sleep and trouble sleeping since childhood. When I finally decided to do something about it, I've done every single thing I could. DAILY, I meditate, do sports, cook own meals (according to SCD diet guidelines- basically only vegetables and meat). Sleep hasn't improved. Only thing that drives me during day is some energy I get from my routine. during sleep, I toss and turn a lot. Its not restless legs syndrome, just tossing and turning every 20 minutes for the duration of night. also had depression, this seems to be gone by mindfulness based cognitive therapy. on top of that, I do some concentration exercises so they equal each other out. I'm calm and I do what needs to be done during daylife. Feeling when I try to sleep when I already had normal hours of sleep (i'm usually sleepy anyway) is like there's something in my head that pevent's sleep. I know this sounds silly, but I can go and fall asleep instantly only after I'm really tired. Anything other is tossing, turning until I sleep and then tossing turning anyway. May this be that my brain doesn't switch off? I've talked to doctors about this, and they say tossing and turning isn't sleep disorder symptom. they say it may be psychological. I have 1 meditation session before lunch and 2 concentration sessions after I wake up and before sleep. I rarely go out of home because of fatigue I feel after walking a lot. and in teenage years I had active life. this exhaustion of mine seems to get stronger and routines I have seem to have less and less effect. I also dropped interacting with people because all I think about is my fatigue and how to cure it. I believe I also have autism, pure mindfulness based cognitive therapy seems to cure it, I was able to ineract with people but was too emotional with them and couldn't get daily things done, so started to do concentration exercises. forgot to mention that when I went to sleep at 11PM and got up at 6AM daily for about 4 months, it got worse when I started to sleep in my spare time ( yes, it sounds silly but even not doing anything during day makes me feel tired) I've listed here all that I know for sure about me, my symptoms. There isn't even decent sleep disorder clinic in post-soviet country of mine so I feel i'll waste my money by going there. I've paid money for quality doctors and their answer before taking money was: we don't know what's happening with you. would someone Please explain or guide me what's happening with me? May it be some hidden cancer symptoms or anything? Because with so much I do to keep my health up I'm still where I was a year ago- tired, always wanting to sleep person.

And also do you drink coffee-soda or products containing caffeine within 6-7 hours before you go to sleep?

It usually happens when I had an emotional day, and usually after 3 or 4 hours of sleep (in the middle of the night, so to speak). To be as clear as possible, I am going to give you last night's example: I work as a camera operator, and yesterday we had quite a difficult shoot, where I made a few mistakes. Nevertheless, I didn't feel too worried, as I know these things can happen. But then, when I wen't to sleep, I \"woke up\" at about 2:30 am with this feeling that I was right in the middle of a shoot. I was aware that there was nobody in my room, but I had this feeling that people could see me and hear me, like they were just behind my door. I wasn't scared - the main feeling really was embarrassment. When I woke up, I was dressed up (I felt like my coworkers could see me in my pijamas, and so I got dressed!), and some items around my bed had moved, like I had tried to make the place look more tidy. Although I can't say that I was awake, I have very clear memories of what I was going through. I remember thinking at some point \"no way, they can't be in my room, it makes no sense\", but then the sensation took over again. That being said, I have no idea of how long it lasted, and I can't remember dressing up, although I can recall moving stuff around. I must also say that there were no actual hallucinations: I couldn't see no hear anybody. The best way I can describe it is this: it's like being in a room and knowing that behind the close door there are people, even though you can't hear them. Once again, it's not a scary feeling, it's just really stressful. So... does anyone have experienced something similar? Does it have a name? I must say I can easily live with this parasomnia, because it's not really giving me a hard time, but most of all I am quite curious, cause I've never met someone who has something similar.

And whichever one I woke feeling like, will switch to the other and vis versa throughout the day. These periods don't happen at all during specific times of the day, but I just switch between tired and energized randomly. And it's not just a normal tired- I feel foggy, and it's difficult to talk or focus, I'm very irritable and hard to make conversation with. Then, an hour later I'll be super alert and focused and talking non stop and jumping around! During my tired periods I can barely hold my head up. It's impacted my life because I can't go to outings or parties with my friends, or even dinner, without getting super tired and irritable and falling half asleep. Although I'm tired during these periods, I usually just fall half asleep but never go into any sort of deep REM. I've been diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia, and a mild form of anxiety. I'm currently perscribed Modafinil 100MG and Lexapro 20mg but neither seem to help my sleepy/awakeness. The switches throughout the day happen with or without medicine. I'm sick and tired of my body being unreliable, and not being to consistently stay alert! Even if I get 9 hours of sleep (which I do on a normal night) I never feel fully rested throughout the day. My eating schedule is normal, and I'm very active in working out. Medium stress level. Does anyone else have this problem or know what it is??

You feel like you perform best during the night feeling alert and awake whereas during the day you would just sleep, sleep and sleep. I could say that I have DSPD, but that's not the point, because I'm aware that this disorder, at least in my case, has it's origin in my social anxiety. I'd rather sleep, instead of having to deal with people, and then when everyone is asleep during the night time I'd reach my energy peak. During the day time I have moments when I'm feeling like I'm about to fall asleep while standing. Sometimes I just feel so tired. And I know it's a sort of vicious circle, because if I don't get a proper sleep during the night, then I will be dead tired during the day. But in the end, it's my choice not to sleep like everyone else, because it's an easy way out for me. OK, so that was me and my messed up sleeping routine. Now, here comes the part related to my question. Today when I woke up around 11 am I was feeling very low and wasn't feeling like getting up at all. I was waiting for my roommates to leave for their classes, before I finally got up. I absolutely hate having to see anyone in the mornings when I wake up. It's one of the worst things ever. I remember back home, I couldn't stand the idea of seeing my own parents in the morning so I was just waiting them out, getting up just after they left home even though I knew I would be late for my classes because of that. Back to the point, today I went to sleep around 5 am and woke up at 11 am feeling like $#%^. Then around 7 pm, I started feeling very sleepy. (Now that I think back to it, coincidentally[?] it was around the same time when my roommates started coming back home.) Anyway, at 7 pm I took a 1 hour nap. The thing is that when I woke up I felt just amazing and what's important had no symptoms of social anxiety. I woke up, went to the kitchen to make myself some tea or something and actually felt very comfortable around people. Normally I'm so self-conscious, it's basically impossible to truly enjoy anyone's companionship (unless I'm very drunk.) This time I actually talked to people, not out of a painful neceessity, but simply because I felt like being friendly. It's actually not the first time, that after taking a nap I feel so good I'm able to storm into the kitchen without giving two sh*ts about people around me. No comparison between how I felt after my today's attempt at getting a night's sleep and after this nap. And I started thinking. If naps as opposed to full time sleep can make me feel so good, why not give up on full time sleeping altogether and substitute it with naps. I googled „no sleep only naps” and what I got is polyphasic sleep. Does anyone have any experience with it? I'm willing to give it a try, since my sleeping routine is already pretty messed up. Any ideas on how this works? Or why today I felt so much better after the nap than the 6 hours “night” sleep? Did anyone have similar experiences? I know that there may be no strict correlation between napping and feeling good, it all may have been accidental, I may not be able to repeat this, and it may not work in the long run but I guess I will never find out, unless I give it a try.", "hash": "8ebbeb6c3d82e9fc0b89a482123e2ffe6699be753bf9a590f28e809f80b6eda9"}

Like all of sudden you're able to come up with solutions that have never occured to you before. I'd even say that it kind of feels as if my IQ went up. Also I remember that when I was back home sleep depravation would result in poetry writing. I've read somwhere that sleep deprivation somehow disturbs the normal way brain wavelenghts work. I think it wasin the context of bashing the old fashioned forensic method of determining someone's sanity based on the graph of their brain wavelengths. The conclusion was that there's no use to it if a person who didn't get enough sleep last night gets a graph of similarly disrupted brain wavelengths as a person who for example suffers from schizophrenia. Also some time ago I noticed that sleep deprivation works as a sort of solution for my hightened self-consciousness and nervousness. It could be that it's because when I don't sleep I'm too tired to be even bothered with what other people say and do. It sometimes feels as if thare always were some sort of white noise in my head that disappears when I don't get enough sleep. And then I'm finlly able to get a clear vision, I'm calmer and more detached. I'm really wondering if that's how normal people around me feel like all the time.

{"url": "https://www.psychforums.com:443/primary-sleep/topic124700.html", "text": "Re: Sleeping problem - Help needed by Ada » Thu Sep 26, 2013 8:56 pm I'm not a doctor, psych or professional. So these are just a random person's thoughts, not formal advice. I would usually suggest talking to a doctor. Just to rule out various problems and to get further support. But, I think perhaps it would be good to look at what you could change first. And then if it doesn't help, that's a good time to get a professional opinion. So, here's a list of things you could try. Ideally, all of them! But whatever you can manage is helpful. Either it'll improve things. Or it's something that you can rule out as having an effect. First, set yourself a bedtime and stick to it. You're in a routine already, but it's not working for you. I'd suggest starting to wind down at 10pm. Get away from all screens, make sure the lights are dim. A bath if that's possible may help to relax you. Some reading [not homework, textbooks, horror novels or anything electronic] might be good. Then head to bed about 11pm and do relaxation exercises, meditation, breathing exercises. Whatever slows your brain down enough to rest. Not necessarily sleep, although hopefully that will happen with time. Second, set yourself a wake-up time. If you're under 25, 8am is a good starting point. [8 hours probably isn't enough sleep for you. People vary, some need 10+ to be functional. Listening to your body over time should help to fine-tune this for you.] Make yourself get out of bed at that time. All the evil techniques you can think of! The alarm on the other side of the room. Family members asked to throw wet flannels at you if you aren't out of bed in time. Whatever you can think of that will work. A glass of water before sleeping might be enough to make your bladder persuade you out of bed when the alarm goes. Third, stop the caffeine. Taper it down during the week, then stop completely over a weekend. Yes, it will be very very hard work. But it's good as an occasional boost. Bad on a daily basis. You're essentially self-medicating with caffeine. If it was working, that'd be OK. Since it isn't, it's good to get it out of your system for the moment. Fourth, you don't mention exercise. That's a really helpful part of good sleep patterns. Even half an hour of walking daily will do the trick. If you can do more, that's better. Best to do it before the evening, in case you get an endorphin rush from it. [This has rarely happened to me. But some people go on about it. And it seems like it'd prevent sleep.] Fifth, you don't mention diet. If you eat lots of sugar, that's something else to try and cut down on. It means you'll be having huge energy swings depending on what you've eaten. Which could be contributing to difficulty sleeping. I'm not suggesting going to an all-lentil diet. Just, aim for healthy if you can. Sixth, do what you can to improve your sleeping environment. If it's noisy, maybe a white noise generator [fan, or do a YouTube search for 9+ hour long white noise videos.] Or earplugs. If it's stuffy, is it possible to have a window open? If it's messy, does this affect your mood? [Some people are fine, others rest better in an organised room.] Is your bed comfortable? Is it neither too cold or too warm? Some of these are major changes. And most of them will be difficult to stick to. But a doctor is likely to suggest similar stuff. Or, worse, prescribe sleeping pills. Then you have those to sleep, caffeine to wake up, and that's not a fun way to live. If you do all these, and your sleep doesn't start to improve, then do get checked out. There are other things that can cause broken sleep, such as snoring, serious breathing issues, and so on. If you live somewhere with access to a sleep clinic, they can do a more detailed study. But I'd cover the basics first in case it's something simple. Let us know how you get on! LOTS of people come here with similar issues.

Make sure to have a couple of alarms so you don't sleep past your wake up time . As for bedtime , try to be in a relaxed state of mind. get away from anything that could distract you from sleeping. try being in a dark room with the fan on and do a little bit of meditation if you like. Third , exercise ! its important to get at least 1 hour of exercise daily . if your tight financially do pushups , sit ups or run around your block a few times , this will not only help you with sleep , but it will also prevent you from major weight gain and increase your cardiovascular system . Last , get on a good eating regiment. this is so important because this is what keeps you going throughout the day. Get rid of those caffeine pills , they do nothing but give you energy for a limited time and then crash and make you feel sick and tired .

I've been having a lot of trouble with snoring – It hasn't been bothering me so much, other than not feeling quite rested after sleep – but it is really driving my wife crazy. It has gotten so bad that we spend about half the time in different beds. That really annoys me – I don't want to sleep apart from my wife! It started maybe 8 months or so ago. At first, we tried to brush it off and get used to it, but as the sleepless nights turned into weeks and months, both of us got tired quick. And I feel terrible, you know? We both work and even then it's hard to make ends meet. If we can't get enough sleep after a hard day, we slowly turn into zombies... We've had “walking dead” periods of a few weeks or even a couple months before. It's not fun. But going to a doctor is, unfortunately for now, out of the (financial) question. My wife doesn't need her beauty sleep – she needs her survival sleep. And I'm getting in the way of that! Anyway, I was searching the net for some sort of cure or product that could help me, and I stumbled across a website reviewing something called a VitalSleep MAD – this website here: http://www.topsnoringmouthpieces.com/re ... italsleep/ . The MAD stands for “mandibular advancement device”, which is really just a fancy way of saying that it holds your jaw in a forward position, and thus (supposedly) ensures a free flow of air through your body. Because apparently it's a very relaxed jaw that drops down and blocks your airways at night, which makes sense – if I try snoring on purpose by laying down and letting my jaw “drop”, my airways are blocked. This is a problem that is affecting my marriage and my health, and adding a heap of stress onto my already hectic everyday life. We're not financially well-off enough to go to a doctor, but I've also learned that it is best to take a step back every time you feel like dropping 70 bucks out of desperation on an uncertain product. Take a step back, and ask people who might have experience with these things. So I'm turning to you all. Pretty please, with a cherry on top – tell me about your experience (if you have any) with this VitalSleep MAD, or any other mandibular advancement device? Thanks in advance!", "hash": "c5cc48cca15b12281f28c1abdde18fb99aa7722f2e7d7a6ff84362034ab76e29"}

I don't know if I have found the right forum section, but I will still try stating my problem here. I am a 26 year old woman. My problem is that I cannot wake up in the mornings by myself. This is not because I dont want to, it is because I simply do not wake up. I have to set an alarm every day, ever since I was young. If I do not set an alarm I wont wake up until noon or even way past noon. I go to bed at regular times between 22:30 and 24:00, which is why the fact that I can practically sleep forever confuses me so much. If I have work or anything else to do its not a problem getting up with an alarm set and i usually feel fine too. But once in a while it happens that my alarm fails (smartphone battery empty etc.) and then I wake up all dazed and confused at the latest hours. It is not that I feel good, because I had a good nap.

My fiancé has the same thing. Although she sets alarm after alarm every 5 minutes, and still she may not wake up for hours. Only when it's an absolute requirement is she able to wake up quickly. There isn't anything wrong with her, necessarily, simply not a \"morning person\". Conversely, I know of individuals who thrive on only 5 hours of sleep every night. Any more time and they feel overslept, any less and they feel as though they haven't gotten enough sleep. Personally, I can go to sleep at any time for any amount of time, and also stay awake for any amount of time (the latter, so long as I haven't been previously exhausted by other means). I usually also sleep through just about anything that would be natural. I've slept through tropical rain storms by the ocean, storms in which the thunder moved my bed around the room. But I'll wake up to something that shouldn't normally occur, such as a glass cup breaking, despite numerous walls and floors away from me. So everyone seems to be dramatically different when it comes to sleeping habits. Yours likely isn't anything too out of the ordinary either. However, you could always ask a doctor if you still feel uncomfortable. \" A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at. \" ~Bruce Lee", "hash": "1bc53d8a9697f248588856822a3c3d187b3be235f5489c39da7be499ec7918ac"}

It's just that your sleep routine is messed up. Why? Because you said that you cannot fall asleep before 5am and then after you do fall asleep you could sleep all day. This is a typical case of messed up sleep routine. It goes in cycles. Because you fall asleep late, you can't get up in the morning. You need your sleep and body doesn't really care that much when you sleep, as long as you get your 6-8 hours of rest. Try this: skip sleeping tomorrow. Don't go to bed at all. Watch tv, go outside, do something to make it trough the night. The next day go to sleep at 10 in the evening. I'm sure you will sleep like a baby. Sleep until 6 in the morning - set the alarm to go off at 6. Repeat this process until your sleep balance is established again.

Anxiety? by Astrongtower » Sun Mar 02, 2014 4:25 pm For the past 6 months my sleep routine has been destroyed. The only thing that I can think of is when I started having back pain only while sleeping. I have no back pain when walking around doing stuff but only in the morning when I wake up. Once every few days or weeks it seems like a can get a full night sleep in I am lucky but lately it has been where I wake up at 2:00 then 4:00 then 6:00 and then finally 8:00 or 9:00. Seems like I sleep a little better right at the end because I am probably exhausted from all the stress of trying to go to sleep. History: A year and a half ago a played around with some GNC products like pro-hormones and stuff and worked out a lot. Been off of that for a while now. I worked out pretty hard. After coming off of that I use to jerk when falling asleep and freaked out. Thought I had something major but probably my muscles where just coming off of exhaustion. Went to the Doctors and had blood work done and he check me out and gave me a physical and said everything was fine. About nine months ago I needed a club to play golf so I went to golf pro shop and swung a club for 4 hours straight and I believe hurt my back. I swung pretty hard for a while. And believe it or not I did it the next day as well; to the point where I had a hard time breathing for a second. I know I am an idiot. I stopped everything and chilled. Maybe only driving range stuff after that. Relaxed for a while then played Disc Golf and threw the Disc as hard as I possible could about six months ago. Played for about 4 hours throwing the disc incredibly hard. Idiot again. Penalties: Well low and behold now I am having back problems only when I sleep and in the morning. But it seems more than that. I do not know if I created a mental loop in my mind but I cannot get a decent nights rest. I have gone to the Doctor again and have had multiple x-rays done and bloods tests taken. Everything came back fine. The pain is only in the morning and there is zero pain during the day. Here is an excerpt of a back pain post that I created to fill you in. Morning Back Pain – Should I Spend Money? Hello Everyone, I know there is so much out there on back pain; but I have a tough money question. I am a returning college student with not a whole lot of money. I am 33 year old male is I would say good shape. I work out decently and have a nice physique. My problem is that one time I went to a golf pro shop and spent 4 hours smacking the golf ball as hard as I could almost too where I had a small pain in my chest and it was hard to breathe for a split second. And if I couldn’t get more stupid I went the next day and did it again. I had to choose a golf club for a class so that is why I pushed myself. I know that was kind of stupid. After like a month I thought I healed up and then went and played Disc Golf and threw the Disc as hard as I possibly could for like 3 hours. I would throw it farther than anyone else. I guess I could have been showing off like an idiot. Well I was working out moderately hard for a while in the gym during all this and never felt any burst of pain really. The only thing that I noticed was a small pinch like pain when I would be watching TV. So then I decided to go to a Chiropractor and he solved that but he noticed that my spine was just slight to the right and my shoulders were a little uneven; but absolutely nothing major going on. This was the first time I ever went to a Chiropractor and it was literally insane. I thought he was going to kill me because I never heard my bones crack like that before and my neck. I think it might have been a littler before the Chiropractor that only in the morning when I wake up I would notice a pain right in the middle of my upper back between my shoulder blades; one time the pain moved to the right of my shoulder blade but that went away. Now all that is left is this ongoing pain in the middle of my back that I cannot for the life of me locate. It’s like it’s the long muscle in my back that go from top to bottom of your back and very close to my spine. I would say mid shoulder to mid back but not upper shoulder or lower back. It is so weird because during the day I feel absolutely great with no back pain at all; even playing Disc Golf or exercising; it is only right after I wake up and while I am still laying down. Pretty much as soon as I wake up everything is fantastic. Only other weird thing is I feel like my ear is ringing on my right ear when I sleep on my right side. This also goes away completely when I get up or move around. Doctor’s Office: I have been to my Doctor several times with this. I have had several X-Rays; nothing bruised on my skin or anything obvious; blood work done for immune system and anything out of the ordinary. I have taken muscle relaxers and anti-inflammatory’s but they are all temporary relief. Seems like the pain comes back. My Doctor is just saying it is like a pulled or sore muscle or something but just seems strange that something so small could cause so much discomfort in the morning. Solutions: My dad has celiac disease but I do not but I read an article about how maybe you could not have the disease but a precursor of it somehow. I do have a lot of joint pain right now like in my Big Toe; Wrist; Neck and sometimes elbow. I have had all these X-Rayed and blood work done to see any causes and nothing major is going on. Here is the Article excerpt: Remove gluten from your diet. Recent studies have shown that some people may have non-celiac disease gluten sensitivity and if so, that may trigger a systemic immune response which can keep joints irritated. This wasn’t too challenging for me since I already didn’t eat breads, pastas, refined grains in general but gluten, as you may know, is in a LOT of foods – like beef jerky for one. Remove gluten for thirty days and pay attention to how you feel. For me, it helped. If after thirty days you feel better then you can always titrate some back into your diet to find your threshold if you want to. I am lost at this point: My main question is that do I put spend money I really do not have on a new bed and pillow with a mattress topper or am I just getting old and have to deal with an aching back and joint pain. Or could I possibly change my diet to a gluten free diet which will be like darn like impossible. I have heard from people’s reviews that they have had much success in changing out the mattress. And I am not even sure where the one that I am sleeping on came from. It’s a Cali-King and seems nice but a little old. I have great Health Insurance. It just doesn’t seem like the Doctors have the answers except Med up or go to a PT. I wish there was more information out there on this. Solutions: 1. Change Mattress 2. Change Pillow 3. Change Mattress Topper 4. Gluten Free Diet 5. Deal with it because you are getting older … Its life … Anything help would be greatly appreciated. Please leave your comments below. Thank You! Best, Astrongtower Update: Now after reading all of this what do you propose? I have been to the Doctors and they do not have the answers. Do I just chalk it up to getting old? I am only 33. I use to play pretty hard but I do not think I destroyed my body or did I? I am going back to school and I do know school and no job is stressing me out. But can it be creating this much havoc? All I know is that I am kind of afraid to go to sleep and it’s a real problem. I have some pain relievers and muscles relaxers but I do not really care for them. I just know that my sleep is absolutely horrible and it is not like it used to be where I could fall asleep like a baby and get 9 to 10 hours a sleep and nothing could wake me up. What in the world happened? I feel like I was just sleeping like this not too long ago. Please help me any way you can! Please leave comments below!

Anxiety? by Astrongtower » Mon Mar 03, 2014 3:12 pm Update: Last night I was able to get 9 hours of sleep somehow. I did wake up at exactly 2:30 A.M. which happens a lot because I think my body clock is off with all of this going on but I was able to go back to bed and I woke up at 9:00 A.M. after going to bed at 12:00 A.M. The difference this time was that we actually found a full body pillow that was in a bag somewhere from a long time ago. The one that literally wraps all around you. I used that last night and I think the difference was I did not sleep on my stomach and I did not toss and turn. Only around 9:00 did my back start to ache a little bit and force me out of bed and I began to toss and turn around the same time as well. I wanted to know exactly where the pain is coming from because it feels like sometimes it could be coming from my Spine or right rib or muscles near my spine. It is so hard to find exactly where. I have a FOAM roller which I get on sometimes to gauge where the pain is coming from. I did it a little differently this time. I put the edge of the FOAM roller in the middle of my back where the pain is and let my butt down and my chest arch up. I would definitely say this helped me isolated the pain to about 4 to 7 inches right along my spine. I could definitely feel the pain in the morning when I do this. I will move like an inch up or down and see if the pain is focused in that area. I would say when I get to my upper shoulders and neck there is zero pain and when I get to my lower back there is zero pain. It only seems to originate like to the top half of my back; like my back is too heavy for itself or something. Or it seems like a computer sitting down problem like I am arched or something over something for a long period and my back is just fed up with all of this. Also the sports injuries probably put it over the top I think. All I know is that the pain seems to be coming from the Spine or the muscles directly around the spine; but I think it’s the spine. I am almost thinking that whatever the Chiropractor did actually made things worse but I could be wrong. I never heard that kind of cracking before. It’s about a 4 – 7 inch radio directly up and down when I get on the foam roller and it does hurt; but only in the morning or if I get on the foam roller in that exact position. As I am typing this there is no pain in my back. Just wanted to update everyone. I hope someone knows what this is. I will be going to an orthopedic doctor soon but I am guessing that he will not be able to conclude anything either. Just seems sad. Please comment with any help or guidance.

Because of this, I think, I'm pretty passive (emotionally and mentally) at the beginning of the day and active at the end, ie, the long wake up. Maybe you can advise me something.

I am the extremely lucky mother of a fantastic 14yo boy. He's bright, funny, and has a great heart. He also has been experiencing some strange episodes over the past year. It started in December 2012, while he was at the computer playing a video game. It was a bit later than usual, but not incredibly late. I was in my bedroom reading when I heard a crash in the dining room. I came in to find my son flat on his back, in a dining room chair. His eyes were wide open and he was 'frozen' in place. I panicked, screamed, yelled, shook him until he came out of it (about 1 minute) and helped him to his feet. He was a little upset about me causing such a fuss, but assured me he was okay. I checked his pulse, respirations, his pupil size and called my best friend (who is a doctor). All signs seemed to point to him being okay. My husband took him to the pediatrician the next day, and we were told he may have nodded off in the dining room and just 'knocked himself out'. We were told to bring him back if it happened again. There were no episodes until September 2013. He had an episode again where he fell, this time out of bed about an hour after going to bed for the night. I heard a crash and walked into his room. He had opened his closet door at some point, only a few feet from his bed. He was laying on the floor between the closet on his back, eyes wide open again and again it took about a minute for him to come to. After this episode, we were able to see a neurologist/pediatric sleep medicine doctor. First EEG came back normal, so we did a 3-day ambulatory EEG. That came back normal as well. The neurologist could not find any signs of epilepsy, and felt it might be more of a sleep disorder. However, she couldn't rule it out since no one knows what causes the fall since it is at night and he's in his room alone. She said to 'live life' and call her if it happened again.She thinks it is more of a Parasomnia, but this doesn't sound like what I've read of parasomnias. Since then, we have moved and we are in a newer/larger townhouse. So, here we are with episode 3. It happened last Thursday, and again I heard a crash. I went into his room and saw his empty bed. I looked again and could make him out on the floor of his room, again with the closet door open. He was on his back, eyes wide open, body rigid/muscles tight. In fact, he was holding something so tight in his hands that I had to pry it out. I was able to notice that he was breathing, at least, so that was reassuring (other times I was too panicked to notice). It took about a minute to get him to come out of it. Afterwards, he just wanted to get a drink and go back to sleep. I called the neurologist, and she said \"wellll, if it happens AGAIN, give me a call. Just monitor him\". At this point, I am panicked. I can't get sleep or rest, especially since my room is on the opposite side of the house. I have been sleeping on the couch so I can hear any sounds. I jump at every sound and I don't know what to do next. I don't know how to help him and it terrifies me and breaks my heart. I am fearful that he will fall and really injure himself, or that he will fall down the flight of stairs that we have here at the house (technically, our unit is the 2nd and 3rd unit of the building and we have a set of stairs immediately when you enter). I just feel so helpless, so I am trying to see if there may be someone who has experienced something similar or might know what more I can do. Has anyone else experienced something like this?", "hash": "b9dd934e76813378d33cf37ffe132f180b773f250b64d14ed0c9898976dc51d8"}

My 15-year old daughter has experienced something similar since she was 13 years old. But what happens is that she just blanks out. She will be sitting and talking and then all of a sudden she has a blank stair and it sometimes last as long as 10 minutes. It happens at school alot and then they call 911 and transport her to emergency but she comes out of it usually in about 10 minutes or less. We did the ambulatory EEG also and nothing happened. It seems to occur if she stayed up too late the night before and/or if she gets really upset or stressed. She has not fallen though. It usually happens when she is sitting down and if she focuses on something or is daydreaming or something and she just blanks out. At one point she had an episode almost like two times a week for about a month. They ruled out siezures and suggested that she see a therapist. Young teens sometimes act out this way subconciously to receive attention, but they are not doing this purposely. When the episodes started she was arguing with her younger sister who is 11 now but was 8 or 9 at the time. The therapy seemed to work and the episodes stopped immediately, but they came back after about a year and a half. She had two last month. But none recently. its still a mystery. About a year before these episodes began she hit her head in the snow while sliding down a hill. We took her to the doctor and they checked her out and said there was know concussion. I know exactly what you are going through. Her attitude is great though, it has not presented any challenges, but she wants to start driving soon so my wife and I are faced with some decisions soon. I don't know if therapy worked or if it was just a coincidence that the episodes stopped for a while (it was no medication, only talking). But maybe you want to give therapy a try to see if it is psychological. Its worth a try. Don't panic, just manage it the best you can while working with the neurologists to find the cause. Stay positive and keep your child's attitude healthy and positive. Sorry I could not give you any more helpful info, but you helped me because I don't know anyone else going through these type of symptoms. Good luck and God bless.", "hash": "49351a3e30f27bec75726530db836bf874fe55046b5e5c8589cf3d3e79273bb2"}

I often have these weird sensations as I'm trying to sleep; I get this bizarre falling sensation. I know it's NOT a hypnagogic jerk, because I don't have to be falling sleep or even feel sleepy for it to happen; it can happen whenever I'm really comfortable and relaxed, so that's why it's usually when I'm trying to sleep, but it can even happen when I'm just really relaxed while sitting down. It's pretty hard to describe, but it usually starts pretty slow, I'll feel like a part of me in my stomach and chest is slowly falling a little bit through my body, but then I feel like I'm falling further and it gets really scary so I change positions and shake myself to get rid of the sensation. Sometimes before it happens I'll feel like my body is gently swaying up and down, or swinging from side to side. I've never allowed the sensation to continue for very long because of how scary it feels and because I'm scared what will happen if I let myself continue falling. As stupid as this sounds, I'm scared if I allow myself to fall too far I'll actually fall through my own body or something. This all started a few months back, when I just spent some time lying in the sun and relaxing, and I started breathing slowly in and out and imagining myself swaying up and down until I could actually feel it, and swaying side to side, or zooming forward and backwards. It was pretty fun, but then all of a sudden I got the falling sensation I described and quickly jumped up. It felt really scary. That night, I had trouble falling asleep, because even though I was really tired, whenever I got even close to falling asleep I'd get the falling sensation and have to sit up or shake myself or something to get rid of it, and then I'd try and fall asleep again but it would just happen again; I also kept getting the weird swaying sensations that I was making happen before it happened for the first time. Eventually, I fell asleep somehow. I don't get it anywhere near as much as that night any more, sometimes I don't get it at all. It often just happens because I'm thinking about it, all I need to do is relax my body and think about it and it'll happen. If I think about the swaying sensations they'll happen too; they're not unpleasant but if I have them too long they lead to the falling sensation, so I don't want the swaying sensations to happen either. I hate it when I end up thinking about either of those things because it makes it hard to get to sleep or relax, because something similar like what happened that night will happen, although not as bad as it was then. Usually the falling sensation happens only occasionally now though and I can often get to sleep with no problems by just not thinking too much about it. But just now, something else weird happened. I was trying to have a nap, but then I felt like my body was rising up a little bit and part of me was being pulled towards my feet. It disturbed and scared me so I kept shaking myself and changing positions to try and make it go away because I was scared I'd end up being pulled out of my body or something. But every time I got comfortable the sensation returned. So I've given up on trying to sleep for now; I really hope this doesn't happen again in the evening because then I'm sure I'll be getting little, if any, sleep. I'm a teenager, female, have never done drugs and have not been diagnosed with any mental health issues, if that helps. And sorry if any of this didn't make sense or I started rambling; I'm a little tired. Any suggestions?", "hash": "89ba28c349c02af29e82656e550b8fec109cc0d827dfecaa4f2454fdaf72849c"}

I am a 22 year old female with a healthy weight and in good health. This started very mildly at about age 14 where I wouldn't wake up to my alarm and my mom would have to wake me up and I would have conversations with her in my sleep and this got progressively worse. I almost slept through a house fire that happened next door 2 years ago (if my partner had not woken me up), and sleep through floor sanders, people moving furniture out of the room, very loud noises. When I do wake up, I feel very tired and never really feel awake. I have slept 36 hours straight, and if I sleep through my alarms, I will sleep for 12+ hours. I have classes from 11:45am - 7:30pm on Tuesday and Thursday, and work from 1:45pm - 10:30pm Friday - Monday. I typically go to bed around 2-3 a.m. and wake up an hour before class or work. I went to a sleep clinic and filled out a 2 week sleep diary and without any testing they diagnosed me with DSPD, suggesting that I take melatonin at 10pm and basically did not listen to the problems I am having. I fall asleep fine and have no trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. I realize I don't have the \"normal\" societal sleep schedule, but I have done it before waking up at 6 a.m. for work and going to bed at 11pm. Even when I have to follow the normal sleep schedule for society, this is still a problem. I noticed when I took Adderall before I went to bed, I would wake up on time and feel refreshed. So I am now taking 10mg Adderall XR before I go to bed, and this helped A LOT. I would wake up to my first alarm, feeling refreshed like I had a good nights sleep, but this doesn't seem to be helping as much after 3 months of taking it. Please give me any suggestions or help you can think of because I am frustrated and tired of waking up hours after my alarms go off and seeing that I've turned them all off in my sleep and not remembering it. I hate missing classes and my grades are dropping as a result. Please help.", "hash": "316af8d493200cc9a026feeb226de8fdee22addbfa73c4daedd396a44fe39e40"}

DSPD is one thing, but sleeping for 36 hours straight, + multiple alarms, house fires and people working around you, is another. It comes as no surprise to many of us that a drug that once helped is no longer effective: your mind/body will \"filter-out\" the effects of the drug so you can \"re-face your problem\", which I suspect is psychological.

It is honestly the strangest experience I've ever had. Obviously, I did not have to go to work and did not have a shift today but while I was napping, I dreamt that even though I wasn't going to work, I believed that I had already completed one of the work tasks (are completed 3 times every shift) for the day and needed to complete another in the late afternoon when I woke up. I was very confused and stressed while I was asleep and was fighting with reality, now what is this about, why do I have to do this when I am not actually working a shift? Then, when I woke up and I was definitely conscious, I was very confused for at least 20 minutes. It felt like reality was warped and I was very upset because I believed I had not been at work when I was supposed to. I just sat there in bed for 20 minutes trying to work out what was going on and I was fully awake. I have never experienced anything to this extent, but I have had periods before where I've felt slightly confused a minute or two after I wake up but they're uncommon.

I'm pretty sure I have Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder, but I doubt these are related to that. About two years ago I started hearing voices when I was falling asleep. I was diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder, but I think the psychiatrist got it wrong. I even told her that I heard them virtually only at night when laying in bed, near sleep, and sometimes shortly after waking up in the morning but still laying in bed. I haven't heard them since about April of this year though. Also, sometimes while falling asleep I'll lose control of my thoughts and start thinking about ridiculous things that don't make sense, and sometimes it can take a minute or so before I realize it and stop. Earlier this year and much of last year I would wake up in the middle of the night not being able to move, occasionally accompanied by hallucinations. One time this past February I felt, saw, and heard two large rats crawling over me, and one time saw and felt a disembodied hand crawl up my torso. Now, I know all of these things can happen in people with sleep problems (and even those that don't), but I would just like to know if the concurrence and frequency of these are indicative of any kind of disorder, or if they just change from person to person.

I hit my bed around 10:30 am and got up just now, around 12:30 pm. I don't think I ever completely fell asleep for whole time frame i was sleeping. Sometimes I'd shift and be conscious of my self and feel like the bed is moving or that my body is elongating for a brief period until I drifted back into sleep. Sometimes I'd become consciously confused between whether what I just messaged someone in my dream was actually sent in real life too. And at last, before deciding to wake up, and what instigated me to wake up, I auditory hallucinated really bad, and it's the most terrifying thing ever. I feel I should also mention that I'm normally capable of lucid dreaming and I do it very regularly, but what I had now isn't really a dream. I think, though, that it's why I was able to wake myself from it on my own will. Just now this is the most I've had it in one session of napping: quietly i would hear a cellphone ring or a door shutting or people picking up \"hello?\" or different phrases from various random conversations, like one between a male and his female friend, \"yeah i'm gonna go on a date\" \"what're you gonna do\" \"i just don't want to\", different female voices, male voices, and just normal hustle/bustle and commotion that one would typically probably hear in cities or whatever, and each thing i \"heard\" while \"sleeping\" would be isolated and separate from the next, there was no overlapping sounds.. I feel as though the things I hear are probably things my subconscious picked up during visits to cities, which makes sense, but I'm just curious as to why I'd even be having auditory hallucinations of them. There was this one thing that set me off and it was just like... a creepy whisper going \"hi there nathan\". an aggresive voice \"hey nathan\" \"what are you doing there nathan\" and it just kept like getting deeper and deeper into my head, like, maybe the perpetrator in my mind was antagonizing this Nathan kid and at the same time antagonizing me by being in my brain? I felt my head hurt. I made myself wake up because it really whacked me out and I didn't want the acquired headache to get any worse. I've had something like that happen before a couple months ago, where I'd heard a beeping noise in my sleep/\"dream\" that gradually got louder and louder until it stressed my head and i had to force myself to wake up because I LITERALLY didn't think I'd be able to take anymore or else my brain would actually explode. That's about the only other time it's happened so vividly. I used to just hear phantom sounds when I was younger, ages 7-12, but it never really gave me headaches like that our disrupted my state, and the noises would be so slight and small and few that it would be like they never even happened. Anyway, auditory hallucinations are terrifying for me. I don't take any meds for anything, despite the fact I've been diagnosed with social anxiety, anxiety, and depression. Also, last night I had some anxiety episode (I'm not one to show physical symptoms of anxiety but I do experience it all just as bad in my head), what with thinking about school and interacting with 'friends' on facebook and feeling like i've overeaten and stuff, so that may also play a part in the reason why I had the auditory attack today? My question is, is this normal? And what's the explanation for why it happened? (I can't ask a psychiatrist or therapist about this right now because my therapy ended when summer started and the psychiatrist I see very rarely is my dad's, and I haven't seen my dad in a while.)", "hash": "60d979494bbe59eb59a19d1275c3accde7bf8445111a8ccf335008914efa684d"}

I am ALWAYS aware of what I'm doing. For example, last night I saw a shadow in my room and believed it to be a child I work with--I could see the shadow moving, woke up my other half who turned on the light and I could still see it, I was looking out the window for them, under the bed and trying to get clothes on. As soon as I \"come round\" I am aware of how ridiculous what I've just done is. Other examples include believing someone else is in bed with me, not my other half. It will usually be a work colleague or a stranger. I'll \"wake up\", feeling panic and (as I sleep nude) will silently feel around on the floor for clothes to put on, often crawling out of bed and out of the door to get away from whoever I think is in the bed. Again, either my OH will, over a period of minutes, convince me I'm dreaming/sleep walking or I will realise it myself by reasoning with myself. I often become agressive as it feels VERY real in my mind until I realise it's not happening and then I feel ridiculous that I could of imagined something. I am awake during these times. I remember every detail about my walking, straight after and the next day. Any ideas?!", "hash": "16f9802e5333e446654e3a7d63b2316dd8f52042431775d5f4ca0b270394b27a"}

I wake up within the first hour of falling asleep (usually first 15 minutes). I jump up, sometimes shout out, sometimes throw the pillows or grab my partner. Sometimes I wake up and I'm in another room or staring out of the window. My heart beats really fast and I gasp for breath for a second. I always thought it was just anxiety or panic attacks in my sleep so I've never seen anybody about it. I'm certain it isn't just sleep apnea although I know I am quite a shallow breather. I've heard about the combination of sleep apnea and panic disorder being a problem though, the shallow breathing bringing on panic attacks. I've been reading about night terrors as well, which sound quite similar to this. I don't think I have dreams though, at least I don't remember them when I wake up in panic. I'm taking Pregabalin for anxiety and zopiclone for sleep. Zopiclone used to stop me waking up in panic but it doesn't do anything anymore. I wake up every single night in panic, sometimes every few minutes for hours, literally all night. The annoying thing is sometimes I can't keep myself awake, I'm so tired that eventually I fall back asleep and it happens again and again. Sorry for dragging this on.

Help. by rua » Sat Jul 06, 2013 6:26 pm Starting this year I was had some violent dreams that caused me to wake. They usually involved arguing with someone, and sometimes physical confrontation. Upon waking, I saw myself sometimes kicking, punching, or hitting the bed. I'm not sure if it happened actually during REM, only in the process of waking, or only after waking. But this morning I believe I hit the wall next to my bed, causing me to wake, as I was doing a slapping motion in a dream. I started doing research on \"violent dreams\" yesterday and was horrified to discover a connection between acting out dreams during REM sleep, often violent, and neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's or dementia, including Alzheimer’s. The name of the sleeping disorder, which I'm not certain I have but am concerned that I might, is called REM Behavior Disorder (RBD), characterized by loss of muscle atonia (paralysis) during REM sleep, resulting in acting out dreams as they happen. Studies suggest anywhere from around a 30% to an 80% of development of such diseases not that many years after onset of symptoms of RBD. They say it usually happens in older males - the mean age is around 60. However, I am in my 20's. I'm not certain that I have RBD - because in most cases I only perceived myself doing these actions after waking up. FWIW, I also have an abnormal sleeping schedule that I seem to tend towards every so often, in which I sleep very late, or in the early morning, and wake up in the afternoon or evening. However, I usually get enough hours of sleep. Based on what I have said, do you think that I am being paranoid or should I go get some advice and/or tests done asap, or maybe first record myself sleeping? If recording myself sleeping, do you have any recommendations as to good recording techniques, software, equipment, etc.? I am mainly concerned about the large file size that could occur.

I am nocturnal, I guess. No matter how hard I try to stay sleeping at night, my sleep schedule gets flipped around, and I'm back to sleeping through the entire day. (I wake up when it's dark or getting dark, and fall asleep as the sun comes up, or short after.) Since I'm currently 17 years old (almost 18), and have been fighting my extremely drowsy days at school for years, I've been home schooled for two years. This problem has been occurring since I was, I think about, 13. The past two years consisted of me trying to stay up the rest of the day so I could force myself to fall asleep at night. I'd obviously, oversleep, or not sleep long enough, and have just given up for a while. I can't get a job. I've lost all motivation in schooling, socialization (which was terrible to begin with, I'm the kid who has no friends.), everything. I feel like I live in a dream world half the time.

It’s pretty awful to be tired all the time. It may not be \"normal\" to be nocturnal but you aren't the only one. Sounds like your circadian rhythm is definitely set differently than most and being out of sync with most people’s schedule creates problems like you’ve experienced. You could try light therapy for resetting your body’s biological clock. It could be good to talk to your doctor too. They could help you determine if sleeping pills or a supplement like melatonin might help you get on the schedule you need to be on. Hopefully, things get easier for you to cope with after you graduate high school, when you have more control over your schedule. If you plan to go to college perhaps you can schedule late day or evening classes. Or, if you end up getting a job, there are 24 hour stores and businesses where you could work. Also, the thing about view count is that views from guests are also counted in addition to registered forum members, but guests are not able to reply, so it helps to create the situation you have here with 100 views but no replies.

I remember senior year of high school I was late every single day. Every single day. I showed up for homeroom the very first day of the year and never again. I also failed my first period class because I was just unable to get to it. Well, almost failed it. What I found out was that basically...in life, there's a way around everything. For example, I dropped that first period class before I technically failed it and took the equivalent class at a community college in the afternoon and transferred it back to high school. I'm now 45 and since then my life has basically been a continuation of that theme - figuring a way around things to compensate for having a weird schedule. The job part is tough. Every job I had I have been threatened with termination because I just never showed up until 10:30 or 11 am at the earliest. Sometimes not until noon. But as soon as I got there I did such good work and stayed at least 10 full hours to make up for it that eventually, it was like...okay, it's no big deal if this guy comes in late if he gets the work done. There are plenty of jobs where you can have weird hours, like computer programmers. They're notorious for weird hours. Overnight help desk support is another one. The more that colleges embrace online classes, the more you can do it on your own time, maybe mixed with evening classes for errr...\"commuter\" students. But here's the bottom line - there are always alternatives out there for people who are wired a bit differently. It's just a matter of doing the research and finding them out. Like at my high school, there was something called the Tutorial Center which was for kids who \"couldn't handle\" regular classes. Basically, it was an afternoon program where you went to an alternative class center where you could do individual work rather than classroom work and have it lead to a diploma - you could even do it in the evenings: link removed There might be something like that you can enroll in. And when I went to college I never had a single class before mid-afternoon, although that meant it took me 5 years to graduate rather than 4. Basically, I've found that if you can get up by 2 pm you can pretty much get stuff done. That means falling asleep at no later than 6 am. And if you can find a way to be self-employed, that makes it waaay easier too.", "hash": "7b811e3fffdbb013c6ae4dcd000449bc891a5c0897d5ee46f15e90de18ae9d20"}

The important thing is that you get SOME sleep, and gradually build it up, even if it means forcing yourself to stay awake in the day time and lying painstakingly for hours in bed trying to sleep.

I've always been interested in the psych fields and have done a bit of research... but I'm dealing with an issue for which I can't find a name. My daughter is going to start seeing a psychologist soon, and I want to go in knowledgable. So, my Daughter is 5. Very intelligent, highly social, but when she gets tired, she can turn into a huge grump. So much so that she's thrown a fit a couple times that seems to have physically harmed her. She's gotten to this state where she seems all locked up... her jaw clenches and she'll stare, wide-eyed making a repetitive growling sound... and is entirely inconsolable. She can hear and is conscious, and I don't suspect it to be a seizure... but for the LIFE of her, she physically can't talk. I've asked \"do you want candy?\" And in her eyes, you can see that she heard the question, but words can't come out. I'll ask \"do you want a cold shower?\" Same thing, but her facial expression says no. \"Do you want huge spankings?\" Same thing, except her facial expression says a BIG no. Her pediatrician (who I believe to be a nut, we're switching), suggested that the only thing we can do is to leave her alone and let her go. When we've done so, it's lasted hours until she has a burning fever, drenched in sweat, starts vomiting until the point of dry-heaving, and complains of a headache after the fact. When we talked about it later, she's said that it felt like something in her throat closed and wouldn't let her talk even though she wanted to and the more scared she was of that situation, the tighter it got until she puts herself into a panic attack. Obviously she doesn't WANT to be in this state, so negative re-inforcement like a spanking wouldn't do anything. And once she's in this state, no amount of hugs or talking gets through because she's so hysterical. Again... her pediatrician says it's \"just a fit\" and not to worry about it. The reason I'm posting this in the sleep section is that I believe it has SOMETHING to do with her sleep... as she's only ever done this when she's very tired and gets upset about taking a nap. It isn't always this bad... but no matter what else she may get upset about... it's only this bad when she obviously needs a nap and has it set in her mind that there's no reason to take one. Once asleep, she also sleeps like an absolute rock. At 5 years old, she still has accidents almost every night and doesn't even notice. She was solidly potty trained while awake at 3, but no progress at night (we've talked to Drs and tried a LOT of things for this). She can also sleep through very loud noises, and if she falls asleep in my arms, I can toss her over my shoulders in a fireman carry and walk around a store for quite a while and she'll sleep right through it. I think whatever it is must have something to do with genetics, her baby brother started sleeping through the night at maybe 2-3 months (also sleeps through smoke alarms... although he's not a grump... if you wake him up early, he's the happiest thing in the world). Her mother still sleeps like a rock and had bed-wetting issues through her teens, as did my wife's father. Not sure about my wife's mother. Some I've asked have suggested that my daughter may be somewhere on the autistic spectrum due to the severity of her fits (also her maternal grandfather is suspected to have aspergers, although never diagnosed)... but she's highly social, highly empathetic, has no attachment to any kind of routine or any fixations on any particular subject, will hug any stranger I let her, has far above average speech/vocabulary... .... yea... So... any ideas for things it might be so I can keep an eye out for the right things for when she does start seeing a professional? I have a small background, minored in psychology and have always been interested because I'm a weirdo and my side of the family are all bat-(blank) crazy.", "hash": "cdf13e7f05f74a1efd50c80090db14307d4f77658bee701bfad3a0d9385d7a29"}

In 2010 something traumatic happened to me. To zone out, I put on an application on my ipod of rain sounds that completely blocks out external noise. From that day onward I continued to use it to help block out external noise. Without that application, I can't sleep. I have gone days without it and I'm an absolute WRECK.I can't sleep at all without it. It is the only thing that gets me to a peaceful state and blocks out external noise. It does not work properly on my phone because my phone does not allow the volume to go loud enough, so it's useless. I am extremely sensitive to any external sounds, like the birds in the morning, light, dogs barking.. etc. I need it if my parents are fighting or talking about me negatively. It's the only thing that puts me at pace. Any single noise will disrupt me trying to sleep. My mind won't calm down without it. Lately, my ipod earphone jack has broken down. It's broken so that sound only comes out of one ear, despite having new earphones. I spend a lot of time twisting, prodding and moving them throughout the night every night so the sound comes out properly. But any slight touch can stuff it up again. This makes for a very exhausting time for me. The first weeks when this happened I was taking it really hard. I still had sleep, but I was depressed and couldn't see properly as I was tired.. That has stopped and I can cope with it better now, but I'm still tired. Tired because I'm not getting the sleep I used to when it was better You have no idea the ridiculous things that I have done involving my ipod and sleep. One time I left my earphones at my mother's place and ran there in the middle of the night to pick them up as she had no petrol. I was that desperate for sleep and that's how much I need them. When I moved back in with my parents, my step father accidentally removed the app on my ipod. They had no modem that could connect to my ipod, so I was in a state of panic for about a month. I begged them daily because I was going through utter hell. Eventually they got it (angry of course) and I was better again. I lived alone for several months, all what keep me sane till I couldn't stand it living there no longer was that ipod solely. I can easily go through 5-6 pairs of earphones a year (or more). When they stop working, I usually go a week till my next pay and suffer during those days of no sleep till I get a new pair. It's so mentally challenging and all I want to do is shut everything out of my head. I don't know what to do about my ipod now, because I can't afford to get it fixed and I don't even know if it's fixable. I HATE being reliable on that to keep me 'stable' with my mental state. Without it I can't function and I'm angry and moody and constantly in a daze. Is there something else I can use to block out all noise with natural rain sounds that I can plug into my ears comfortably? I have thought about a stereo, but that won't work because I will rip it out of the hole when I toss and turn at night and probably break the earphones. My room plug hole is too far away from my bed too. I am happy about buying a rain sounds CD, as long as it doesn't contain thunder or birds in the music and keeps playing the same thing for about 8-10 hours. But I don't know how I could use that so I blocks out the neighbours dog or my parents.", "hash": "f2b886764b2455483e3c9016a54747f448b74a232c4eb2e12e32541459e87d7e"}

So, a couple of thoughts. You could get a rain sounds CD and rip MP3s [or you might find some online for free. YouTube might have long-playing videos of rain that could work. And use something like http://savevid.com to make an MP3.] Then use a cheap MP3 player to hook yourself up at night. But that isn't an long-term solution. You need to wean yourself off this somehow. I don't usually tell people what to do. And you are COMPLETELY welcome to ignore me. I am just a random person on the internet. Only, this seems like it would make it difficult to share a bed with someone in future. And it's not usual for sleep to be so dependent on an external factor. Perhaps you could try dropping the volume a VERY small amount each night. So that the change is imperceptible. Over time, it will add up. You'll be getting yourself used to hearing little sounds while you sleep. And ignoring them, like you used to do. OR, you said that you're beginning to cope with the broken ipod so perhaps it's better not to look for an alternative at all. But continue to push through, waiting for your sleep to get back to normal. Also, with the traumatic event, have you spoken to anyone about that? If it's still causing you issues, that could be appearing as this sleep disorder. In which case, relieving your dependence on the app might cause a different anxiety issue to appear. And perhaps working through the trauma more might ease your sleep anxiety. Just another thought. “ We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity.

I also don't know where else to post this, because I would like input from from a psychological and spiritual viewpoint both (if the latter applies). Anyway just a little bit about me, though you may skip this paragraph if you wish. I'm currently in college working for my Bachelor of Arts in Psychology, because the subject interests me, and I'm hoping to go somewhere in the future with this field. However there are many things I wonder about, which, as a future psychologist, I would like to understand so that I can explain to future patients. Like with many people, I tend to forget my dreams. Sometimes I will remember some pieces here and there, but everything else is lost in my memory. I've had a moderate amount of dreams in which I could remember a lot, if not, all of it. But never have I ever sleep walked before (at least to my knowledge). Except this one time... I was staying at some apartment/hotel (cannot remember which) with my parents, and I want to say I was in my mid-teens or so, maybe 16 or a bit older. My parents went to sleep, and I went to my room to lay on my bed. Now before I mention anything else, you guys know that tingly feeling you get when your foot is asleep? I believe it's possible that I may have slept in a funny position, but instead of it affecting my foot, it was somewhere in the back of my head, perhaps between the neck and head (medulla? I could be wrong). Anyway, I do remember a tingling sensation of some sort, especially after I woke up, but I will get to that later. During my sleep, I got out of bed, and I was aware that I was doing so. I walked over to the kitchen, and I was doing something at the counter, but I cannot remember what. Then I instinctively peer down at the ground, and notice that: 1) I cannot feel the ground beneath me, yet I felt it when I was walking to the kitchen 2) I felt light 3) I was floating, possibly several inches above the kitchen floor My reaction was surprise, and even though I was aware that I had been lying in bed moments before, I could not tell if I was sleepwalking, or if I was dreaming that I was doing this. Everything else that happened after that was very blurry in my memory, but I was somehow back in my bed (cannot remember how I got to it), and I found myself desperately trying to wake myself up. After being seemingly paralyzed for a minute, I finally \"woke\" up. I could feel the back of my head tingling with that sensation of 'your foot having fallen asleep' but on the head instead. Scared, I darted over to my parents bedroom and woke them up. I described to my mom what had happened, but she was too sleepy to decipher the meaning, and told me to go back to sleep. I never told her about it again, until recently, and she said that I should do some research on this, because it is unusual. It can't be that unusual, because I've been reading about people expriencing some similar things. Does anyone have some kind of explanation for this? Was it really related to how my body was positioned when I fell asleep, or something else? Thanks", "hash": "ed88b384e39b01cafcc7dd70ae94567a38a3f4f8d1cf8e03d2274964927f37f4"}

It's nearly impossible for me to wake up in the morning, no matter how many hours of sleep I get. When I'm finally conscious enough to wake up I'm still so tired that if I close my eyes again I'll immediately fall asleep. Getting through the day is a nightmare because it's a constant struggle to stay awake enough to focus on anything, to have enough energy to be functional. I've been on psych meds for years and no matter what I've tried I still feel sedated (even with the kind that are said to be more energizing, like Wellbutrin). It seems regardless of what I take I'm fatigued. I often take caffeine pills in hopes that it will wake me up....it seems to \"physically\" keep me awake (i.e., I can feel my heart rate speed up) but I am still yawning non-stop and sleepy. My doctor put me on Nuvigil a couple of months ago, it seemed to help for a few days then stopped (so he increased the dose from 150mg to 250mg). I've continued to take it even though I still drag through the day trying to stay awake. I took Provigil years ago with a similar problem. Is there no hope for this? I mean, aren't Nuvigil and Provigil praised for being the ones that can help in extreme cases like that? Is there something else anyone knows of or has tried?", "hash": "d716753c5b4eecc48a642ea5c689b209347d1b688fe1fccfd290ce632ac0e58f"}

I've been diagnosed with Circadian rhythm sleep disorder, meaning that my internal clock isn't what it should be. Treatment is melatonin and/or light treatment, none of which worked. I've tried every single sleep hygiene tip that's out there, and now given up. I'm tired of not having functioning sleep, and I was hoping you could have any ideas. The problem has been different, sometimes extremely little sleep (1-4 hours a night for six months) where I was simply unable to fall asleep at the correct time. I always started waking up in the evening, making it impossible to sleep. Since I had to get up at 5 in the morning for school at that time, sleep was scarce. I completely collapsed and flunked out of school after that, and I feel I haven't really recovered since. Some months i can't sleep more than four hours at the time, sleeping several times during a day. Some months I seem to have a normal sleep, where I feel I can function pretty well. Now, for quite a few months, I've been unable to function during the day unless I have 10-16 hours sleep. If i have any less, or more, I'm tired and drowsy all day and my mind just doesn't function. Needless to say that any attempt on a normal life with this sort of sleep pattern is rather difficult. It doesn't help that I'm awake most of the night, and sleep most of the day. I'm lucky if I get to the store. I also get extremely tired very easilly, and if I have an early appointment that only lets me sleep for about 5-6 hours (which should be sufficient for a normal person) I'm knackered for days. I don't drink caffeine anymore, I gave it up in hope of improvements. There hasn't been any so far. I don't smoke, drink or do any drugs, except for prescribed medicine. I've been on and off on sleep medication (I'm afraid of getting hooked). I'm thinking that it might have somthing to do with my recent asperger diagnosis. Sorry for the long post. I really hope someone out there could have any ideas.", "hash": "fafb854e5df8fd48ff95b20c696aec86ac9205689257c5932398ec7f15d97b97"}

First i'll explain what i've been going through best I can. (important note: i work the graveyard shift, from midnight-8:30am usually. generally i like to get home from work, do a couple things, then go to sleep before noon. then, sleep for a while, wake up around 7pm or so, and have my time to do things then, after sleeping and before work.) It all started about 4 months ago, give or take (bad memory). One night, out of no where, i slept until 11 pm (i try to leave the house to go to work around 11:40 pm). there was no gradation between waking up at a normal hour and waking up at a late hour like that. it just suddenly happened one night. ever since then, most nights, i wake up right around 11 pm no matter what i do (usually about 11:15 pm. i call it 'amityville horror curse' since it feels like it anyways). it can vary, sometimes a little earlier, sometimes a little later. once in a blue moon i will sleep even later (to the point that i'm ate for work, but still sleeping) or even rarer, i'll wake up earlier (and by earlier i mean about 10 pm). now, it's not like usual, where someone wakes up, hits the snooze, goes back to sleep. aka, making a conscious decision to go back to sleep. i literally hear nothing, and don't wake up, and have no ability to wake myself up. my body just wakes up when it wants to, and there's nothing i can do about it. so i'm nearly terrified to sleep, since i don't know if, when i wake up, i will already be late for work, or what. i've tried several different things to wake up. i already have 3-4 alarms, and have tried setting them earlier, later, etc. nothing works, and usually i never hear them. i've tried sleeping with the tv on and off. i've tried sleeping earlier and later. nothing changes anything. i, on average over these months, sleep about 12 hours a day (sometimes i go through periods, like now, where i'm saying screw it and going to sleep around 4 pm, and getting about 7 hours of sleep). now, another thing is that no matter how long i sleep, i wake up completely exhausted (one day on my day off, i slept 24 hours, not waking up once in between. i woke up, and still felt tired later), to the point that about an hour after waking up, i am nodding off and falling asleep (not good for work). i at least have been prescribed some medication recently (used for a mental illness, but can double to work on lethargy), which at least keeps me from dozing off when i'm awake. on a rare occasion i will wake up to the alarms, a phone call, or just for no reason. but i literally can't get up/make it out of bed before falling back asleep. now, i've gotten blood tests and nothing is abnormal. i don't have anemia, or thyroid problems. i can pretty much already rule out sleep apnea. i had a suspicion that it could maybe be chronic fatigue syndrome, but i don't know. i'm trying to apply to do a sleep study. i know it's not just simply 'being depressed'. i've had depression my whole life, and have dealt with it. it wouldn't just suddenly effect me. besides, it doesn't explain being exhausted after sleeping plenty, or not ever waking up during sleep for any reason, until my body wakes up on it's own. it's not because of my work shift, since it still doesn't explain not having energy, and i've been at this job over a year and am fine with it. i didn't change any prescriptions (or anything else for that matter) around the time it started. i'm completely stumped, and annoyed. i literally don't have a minute of the day to myself. i have no time to clean, walk my dog or do anything with him, to relax, to do anything. i know people say all they do is sleep and work, but that's *literally* all i do most of the week. it's horrible, and i really can't have it effect my job anymore, because it's been effecting that to a degree. In summary: - I sleep long hours (against my will) but never gain any energy, and am so exhausted when i'm awake that i need to take prescription medication to keep me awake. Nearly positive it is not: - depression/emotions -medication/diet/etc. change -laziness -thyroid issues -anemia -sleep apnea If anyone could give me any insight or suggestions or anything else, it would be appreciated. In the meantime, i hope to find a sleep study as soon as possible, and hopefully that can shine some light on the issue. [edit: just an added note, don't think it has much to do with the issue but figured i'd add it. since around that time i've noticed that i must bite/grind teeth in my sleep because i often wake up with the insides of my cheeks and lips shredded. not bleeding usually, but the outer layer of skin is shredded to bits.] ☥fiat justitia ruat coelum☥ Rex - 22 - Male - Host Duke - 31? - Male - Alter non-diagnosed", "hash": "afe151d03b4f94cf9ac36bb9341558636adf7f61ebabbffb4eb2272abdb4e774"}

But if you aren't already, I'd recommend a sleep diary, logging when you went to sleep and got up. And perhaps some notes on diet and exercise, since they can influence sleeping patterns. You've ruled out a major effect from them, but you might catch something more subtle over time. I wonder if it might be a cumulative sleep debt, that's built up over time. It might be that 7 hours just isn't enough and you actually need 12 hours. Some people do. I'd recommend as much of a routine as possible, both in your timings and in how you prepare to sleep. And stick to that on your days off, too, so your body can trust the cycle. And check your teeth with a dentist to see about the biting.

It's like my mind gets so wrapped up in deep thoughts or daydreams that I can hardly do anything quickly. I often find myself staring into nothing once I realize I'm daydreaming again. It's like I can't really control it. When I take showers, I always find myself staring at the faucet for 10 minutes or so before I realize I'm supposed to be taking a shower. When I go to the bathroom to do something like brush my hair or teeth I find myself staring into space, simply letting my mind go wherever it wants. It hasn't usually caused me much trouble other than people complaining about me taking way too much time to do things. Of course, what am I supposed to tell them? \"Oh well I was staring for 10 of the 15 minutes I was in there.\" Of course not. My family would think I've lost it if they knew this was an every day thing. The days that I can cope with it and keep myself occupied are unfurtunately the days that I have the worst anxiety issues. It's like I need to have my head in the clouds in order to escape unnecessary panic all day long. I feel like it drags me down completely. I can't just be alert and calm at the same time. I would much prefer a life without these disorders, but I have to learn to cope with such things. Most of my daydreams are about situations in my life or daydreams about what would happen if I acted a certain way. It's like a whole scene plays in my head and I can't help it. Also, a lot of them are about storylines, mainly a character in the book I've been writing, and anime (yes, I am a total nerd). Some nights I just lay in bed for hours consciously dreaming about things like that. So much so that I often lose a lot of real sleep. However, I've been working on that book for over 4 years now and I've only gotten the footnotes and chapter one written. I start writing and then I begin to daydream. Most people call me lazy, but I can't control it very well. I'm not a lazy person. I simply can't help the fact that I get caught up in thoughts and daydreams. It really makes me lose all motivation. I end up wasting too much time on things and they never get finished. I don't even know what career field I want to go into! I've been in college for two years now for advertising and business, and after daydreaming about medical things, I've now decided I want to study in the medical field. Oh and apparently I'd like to open a cafe, and be a mortician, and start a charity, and become an artist, AND be a writer, teacher, musician, music producer, and a vetinarian. It's like all these fantasies influence my personal choices and I have a hard time figuring out what I really want in life. I feel as if this disorder completely gets in the way of my everyday life, and I fear deeply that it's going to leave me with an empty future as well. Any insight on this would be greatly appreciated. \"Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door.

And the worst is, it's not a diagnosable disorder. So you might find a therapist or psych willing to work with you on it. But you might also find them trying to label you schizophrenic, delusional, depersonalised or a number of other variations. Insights. I've done it for 25 years, so in my case it hasn't worn off by itself. There's a recent discussion depersonalization/topic94387.html which might be relevant. It's hard to separate it from \"normal\" issues. I think not knowing \"what you want to do with your life\" is quite common only made worse by MDD. It's not [I am not a psych, this is only opinion] a result of MDD. Yes, it may well mess up the future. I haven't done NOTHING with my life. But I wonder what would have been different if I hadn't been spending 6-14 hours a day daydreaming. I haven't unpicked the relationship between MDD and anxiety. I suspect that I might have been so anxious in the past because of the effects of MDD. But at the time, it very much felt like MDD was, as you say, an escape from it all. I also wonder if it's linked to OCD because of the compulsive and intrusive nature of the thoughts. It's stressful to try to choose not to daydream. I've stopped at the moment by taking n-acetyl cysteine [an amino acid] which I started to try and lift mood. Had no effect on that but it was like an off-button for my daydreaming. It doesn't work consistently! But my advice is to research as much as you can and experiment SAFELY. I had bad side effects from inositol which is helpful for OCD [which is why I tried it out]. Just because it's from a health food shop, or is labelled a supplement, doesn't make it right for your body chemistry. Seeing a psych may help, it's worth printing out an MDD info sheet to take with you. If they're willing to listen, they can be really helpful in tackling the anxiety which may be a trigger for you. And perhaps with the MDD too. Just be REALLY sceptical about taking prescribed meds. Research them first. And let us know how it goes. “ We think too much and feel too little.

Have you considered having a sleep study? It is possible you may have sleep apnea or other medical issues. Consider 1st going in to see your regular doctor to rule out thyroid issues, etc. Also, are you on any meds that might cause fatigue, sleepiness,etc? I have a similar prob w/ hypersomnia I was diagnosed w/ sleep apnea 11 yrs ago and now sleep w/ a CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) machine. It helped immensely since my apnea was pretty severe so I wasn't getting into the deeper stages of sleep. I still cant go a night w/out wearing the machine but I still can sleep 12 plus hrs a night if I didnt need to be up for work, etc. So on my days off, I feel like crap after oversleeping. Partially for reasons of guilt. Makes me feel like a lazy bum But it is a vicious circle regarding getting up and moving or staying active. When you lay around all day, you feel even more tired and less motivated.....i know, easier said than done. But once you get the ball rolling as far as exercising it becomes easier. \"You must expend energy to get energy.\" So exercising gives you more energy, not less.

The hypnagogic state is the borderline between sleep and waking. When one's mind is alert, but the body falls asleep, one experiences conscious hypnagogia. Interestingly, this hypnagogia can be induced intentionally, by performing a progressive relaxation technique. Usually, hypnagogia begins with simply shapes and colours forming behind the closed eyelids, along with voices and sounds. Music is rarely heard during this state- but is definitely associated with it. Hypnagogic images may start to appear, which will gradually increase in complexity. A wake initiated lucid dream (WILD) can result as the hypnagogic imagery evolves, and eventually forms dream scenes. Consciously observing a dream forming in front of your eyes is an amazing experience. In no way is hypnagogia harmful- it is a completely natural event. Sometimes, the voices repeat words multiple times. Just like it is difficult to remember dreams, remembering all the details of hypnagogia can also be difficult. The main difference between hypnagogia and dreams is that hypnagogic images are highly static, and lack narrative content.", "hash": "fe79a9a32c5a729c90d0b4eba569dbd7558eb92873da60690c543909625e1537"}

I strongly suggest 9 pm or 10pm but it is, of course, your choice. There are three things you need to do: a - spare 1-3 hours (once) for doing nothing but contemplating on the fact that life is more than results, more than economic gain and more than any other measurable results. It is more. b - decide on the time for sleep and when the time comes, let everything go and just go to sleep. It's really not as important as you imagine :] c - spend 30 min. to 1 hour every day for the next two week during which you would be thinking about what works need to be done, which ones do not need and etc. - how to simplify and increase the effectivenes of your activities in order to finish everything 2 hours before your sleeping time (this will be your buffer).

Getting up can be really hard though. I get really bad sleep inertia, when I can fall back asleep very easily for at least 40 minutes, and much longer if I actually fall asleep. Also if I am sleep deprived, I can sleep much longer than normal, easily over 15 hours. Most of the reason I skip a night's sleep is that I'm afraid I wouldn't bother getting up or wouldn't be awoken by the alarm since I'd be too tired.

I'm not one of these people who can crash the second they hit the pillow. It usually takes me 10-15 mins on average to fall asleep, sometimes up to an hour, sometimes 3-4 hours. But whenever I get to sleep I never remain asleep the full night. I will usually wake at about 3am, have to go back to sleep, wake again an hour and a half later, go back to sleep, wake, re-sleep for 45 mins etc... I can never sleep more than 4-5 hours in a block and after the initial 4-5 hours it's 45-90 minute blocks maximum. It gets to the point where I just aren't tired enough to go back to sleep so I wake up. I'm almost never refreshed from sleep, I'm constantly tired throughout the day. Even if I then go to bed early - eg 9pm/10pm - I won't fall asleep till 1am. Sleeping pills have almost no effect on me, even prescription ones. I still exhibit the same pattern. My last two gf's have both been the types that can fall asleep in a minute and be out like a light for 10-12 hours if they're tired. I really wish I could get that kind of sleep but for me, it's broken nights sleep every night of my life and some times I get so frustrated with being unable to sleep I just get so angry and in despair and upset. I can't remember ever having slept through the night or getting more than 7-8 hours in a night (and that 7-8 hours being broken sleep).

This will help you to see if there are any patterns for good or bad nights, and also gives you evidence if you need to go back to the doctor.

I've been doing it for literally YEARS!!!! I was \"diagnosed,\" with ADHD as a youth, and was prescribed appropriate meds for it, which I had stopped taking when I had entered the military nearly 14yrs ago. I feel like sleep is a massive waste of time, and if I didn't need to be at 110% for my next day, I wouldn't sleep. I could literally find millions of things to do with myself in the time, and STILL never feel like I got anything done. It's not that I don't enjoy sleeping; when I'm tired, I LOVE curling up to sleep, but I find absolutely ZERO enjoyment out of sitting in my bed, wanting to sleep. If I go to bed at 0500L, I get up at 0900L, as if I just got 8hrs of restful sleep.. If I get 8hrs of sleep, I feel okay.. If I get more than that, my body is sore, and my head hurts.. I never thought there was anything wrong with me and always felt like there was something wrong with my friends who DID sleep for 9+hrs. Some folks blame it on the military, but I beg to differ; it's ALWAYS been like this. Without sounding neurotic, I have been starting to feel like there's something wrong with me, because I have been fighting sleep lately, as I've been getting older.. I just don't want to give in to it. Now before people get on me for the \"health,\" concerns, I'm aware of how bad it is to not get enough sleep. I still get my sleep, just not in a Circadian rhythm as others do.. It's not helping that I'm in college, and that my sh-t insurance only covers some visits to things like Counselors and Psychologists.

I did a sleep study and the Dr showed me the results. Apparently I was spending most of the night in sleep stage 2 and 3, and only occasionally getting to stage 4. I snore. And when I would snore, I'd know myself out of stage 4 sleep and partially wake up. During this half awake stage, I'd be able to act out dreams. Funny that it's always punching though. SOmetimes screaming. The doc said it was probably my SNRI meds that were causing this... if I weren't on them my snoring would not wake me up.

Usually I cant move period when it happens, and I don't really feel much of anything. Occasionally I see the random hallucination of a figure made of shadow doing a whole lot of nothing but standing on the other side of the room until the paralysis wears off. This time was completely different though. Rather than gradually waking up like usual it felt like I was just jerked awake like someone had just hit me or something. After waking up I immediately became aware of the sensation of being electrocuted, and it hurt. I wasn't paralyzed though, I could still move but it just made it worse and hurt more when I did. I also hallucinated something completely different than usual, but I don't think it's all that important(It involved one really freakin' tall alien) and it only lasted about a minute or so until everything felt like it just fast forwarded a good few hours to the point where it just started get light outside and I'm completely covered in sweat and it feels like I'm on fire. I had to get up and jump in an ice cold shower to cool off. I'd somewhat gotten used to my Sleep Paralysis for the most part despite it not being all that common, and then this comes out of left field. I've felt shook up all day and I even had a minor panic attack over it earlier.

I'm a 19 year old female. and I think that what I have been experiencing is sleep paralysis, but I want to be sure it isn't something else. This has been going on for around a year or so. Here goes: So, sometimes I'll wake up and I can't move or speak. I can control my breathing and if there is someone else in the room I try to breathe more heavily or quickly to let them know what's going on so they can wake me up but it has never worked. It Always feels like I'm in slow motion. That's the biggest thing. I feel like I'm moving in extreme slow motion, but I somehow know that I'm not. I usually know exactly where I am and what is happening as it has been happening for around six months now so I'm never really frightened. I can sometimes wake myself up my twitching my face or jerking my head. But, if I do this I will sometimes fall straight back to sleep. In times when I can't wake myself up, I end up willing myself back to sleep. It has happened in the middle of the night, in the middle of the day when I'm taking naps, and even in the car when I'm sleeping on road trips. If it happens once, it's likely to happen again if I go back to sleep, but it does not happen every time I sleep. Usually it is around twice a month or so. It's strange and I want to know if you all think it's sleep paralysis or something other than that?

{"url": "https://www.psychforums.com:443/primary-sleep/topic77738.html", "text": "Delayed REM, but not full on DSPS? by neal88 » Mon Nov 21, 2011 11:34 pm I've always had trouble waking up in the mornings, and in the last two years it's gotten exponentially worse, but the doctors can't figure out what's wrong. This is a long, detailed story so bear with me: Background: From elementary to high school, I had to wake up at 6AM, and according to my parents I was always hard to wake up, and it was always hard for me to fall asleep. I don't recall any of this (or much of my childhood period), and I'm still having extreme difficulty waking up. But here's the kicker: I don't have any problems going to sleep and I don't wake up in the night . Usually, I go to bed anywhere between 11:30 and 12:30. I have no problems going to sleep, and I fall asleep within 20 minutes. I don't wake up in the middle of the night (that I can recall). When my alarm clock, which is situated across the room, goes off anytime before 10AM, I get up out of bed in a foggy, drunken-like stupor, hit the snooze button, carry the alarm with me back to bed, and go back to sleep. As the alarm keeps going off every five minutes for the next hour or two, it is constantly interrupting my dreams and I continually wake up in a foggy stupor and hit the snooze button. My wife will try to wake me up and I will talk to her in my sleep, and then never remember any of it. By the time I wake up, it's 10-11AM and my body feels horrible (almost aching all over) and I'm fatigued for the entire day. Occasionally I will have \"excessive daytime drowsiness\" in addition to the fatigue. My wife also mentioned that she has dreams in the middle of the night , while I notice that I only have them in the late morning , which is what tipped me off that something isn't quite right. Environment I've lived in the same house for 22 years. 11 years I slept in a downstairs bedroom, 11 years I slept in an upstairs bedroom. Suffered from the same symptoms, though not as bad as recently. Moved to a new place 8 months ago, and the fatigue and sleepiness hit me really hard the last 3-4 months. Two years ago I spent most of March in Japan, where I walked all over the place and was passed out asleep by 10PM and woke up at the crack of dawn, completely alert and awake, with no fatigue and no drowsiness during the day. Come back home, suffer from jet lag for a month and a half, then I'm back into the same old painful cycle. Spent a week this Spring in Hawaii, still slept late, had mild fatigue and no drowsiness. Spent 8 months this past Summer in California at an intensive language program where breakfast was at 7AM, classes at 8AM. The first 5 weeks I went to bed around 12-1AM and struggled to wake up in time for 8AM class. Last 3 weeks I went to bed at around 11-11:30PM and was barely able to wake up by 7AM, but was able to get breakfast and get to class on time. Did not suffer from any fatigue or drowsiness at all. Came home, I started sleeping even later, and feeling even worse. The only two environments where I did not suffer from this problem were California and Japan, Japan being the better of the two. Doctor Visits I went to my physician. He tested me for Vitamin D, HIV, and some other run-of-the-mill stuff. Couldn't find anything. I went to an endocrinologist. He checked Thyroid, Liver functions, Testosterone, Quartisol, Vitamin D, bone density. Didn't find anything wrong with me other than osteoporosis (at the age of 23 no less) and completely ignored my other symptoms and focused on the osteoporosis. Went back to my physician, said the endocrinologist wasn't helping and things were getting worse. He said that I have a \"narcoleptic feel\" and referred me to a sleep study. Went to a sleep study. Went to sleep at 10:30PM, they woke me up at 5AM. I woke up completely awake and alert, rested and refreshed. Which never, ever happens at home. Sleep doctor said my sleep study was normal. After I explained to him that I did not experience any problems at the sleep study, he thought that my problem could be environmental. Then I told him that I've had the problem at 3 different locations, excluding Hawaii, hotels, etc. Then I mentioned that the alarm clock keeps interrupting my dreams. He said that that would make sense if my REM phase is delayed, and that the alarms are interrupting my REM sleep and I'm not getting any rest. So he suggested I push my sleeping schedule back an hour. Currently I'm going to bed around 11-11:30PM, trying to wake up between 6:30 and 8:30. I still can't do it. If my REM sleep doesn't start until 5AM, and doesn't end until 10AM, how am I supposed to wake up and have a normal life? I've already had to drop a 10:20AM class because I couldn't make it in time, and my cognitive functions are going down the toilet and I can't concentrate because I'm not getting any rest. And to make things worse, I have a 9:10AM class next semester that I have to take. Is there anything I can do to get my butt out of bed in the mornings?", "hash": "8d5573aff0d67b18ec8ad3b4798ef0b01501ec53c1223d5c5a96540e741c847b"}

RLS gets worse as you get older and WAY worse if you are a pregnant woman. No treatment or drug ever works long term, so you will have to develop a good relationship with a neurologist that is an expert in the disorder so you can keep tweeking your medication routine as needed and even take \"medication holiday\" to bring your tolerance back down to the point where meds can help. Fibromyalgia is highly correllated with RLS. The pain that you are experiencing could be due to Fibromyalgia symptoms and may be controlled by anti-depressent meds that focus on dopamine and/or seretonin receptors. On line support groups are a great help. There is one through USC that is monitored by a leading expert in the subject and he gives EXCELLENT advice.

When I was in like 4th grade I used to sleep like a corpse in a coffin, I woke up the same, without even undoing the bed! haha it freked me out a little. It has been a range of all sort of positions since, like the ones you mentioned, and sometimes it seems like a tornado pass thru with all the movement. I remember a couple of weeks I had an ingrown toenail because I was pushing my toe against something hard while sleeping and other things due to bad positions. I´m very anxious since I remember so that's the answer. it's definitely a mix of a reflection of the state of mind, weather, health condition and other things, but mainly the first one, I think.

Does anyone else have this? Are there medications that help with this? I was told I do not have a sleep disorder except my EEG showed I had alpha wave intrustion. I cannot seem to get enough sleep. I can sleep most of the night and half of the day. 14 hours easily. I am not depressed. Although I've been having some medical problems related to gastrointestinal partial paralysis/severe IBS. I also cannot sleep on a set schedule due to chronic pain. Alpha EEG Sleep Anomaly - Alpha wave sleep disturbances are common in patients with FMS and/or myofascial pain syndrome (MPS). Delta sleep is interrupted when alpha waves intrude. Alpha waves can wake patients up, or just prevent them from getting a good quality of sleep, which usually results in more pain. K-alpha waves, which mainly occur during stage two sleep, create poking sensations. Experts believe that K-alpha waves also contribute to GI (gastrointestinal) problems and cause muscle pain. This sleep anomaly affects mostly women FMS patients. Although K-alpha is similar to PLMS, it may not be caused by the same mechanism.", "hash": "2b8e1fa11f9d601c50de6b2e7a2b399388cfc81b5efc831946f8da4bcdc346b1"}

It seems to be getting worse, it's driving me crazy and i want to get a life now that i am a Mum! Ever since my late teens I have always needed heaps of sleep and have always felt extremely tired. I have never had any energy or stamina and I always feel generally 'achy' and sometimes 'spaced out'. It is not unusual for me to sleep for 12+ hours and still wake-up feeling exhausted and in need of more sleep. I never, ever wake feeling refreshed and require several very loud alarms going off repeatedly to actually rouse me. I never wake, not even to use the toilet. I have visited the GP at least 4/5 times and had tests for Anaemia, thyroid disfunction, diabetes, glandular fever, White cell count, kidney/liver function and endless other things all of which have come back negative. [I almost wanted 'something to be wrong so that at least I know what it is and can be treated] Other than doing the tests, the gp's have never taken me seriously and once the results have come back negative, they have almost 'dismissed' me as being depressed or made me feel like I was making it up. I have almost felt embarrased or akward as if I had an illness to be ashamed of. I have more or less resigned myself to having to live with it and just get as much sleep as possible but I have never really had any sort of 'normal' life. I don't really achieve much, [if anything] some days and most importantly of all I now have a gorgeous, wonderful son and I can't be the mother I want to be. I want to be able to care for him properly, to play with him properly but I can't because Im always so worn out, all I want to do is sleep, or at least rest. In addition, obviously my 15 month old wears me out more because he is constantly on the go and into everything and I cant keep up with him. I get so tired I want to drop and then I get moody and irritable. In addition, I also suffer from severe back pain [and general stiffness in the joints, particularly the knees] I have been diagnosed with oesteo arthritis of the spine. I regularly take diclofenac or other strong painkillers to alleviate the pain.... Prior to having the baby, although I did not like having to live with the constant exhaustion, it was 'manageable' - I simply slept for very long periods [sometimes 18+ hours, all day and night constant sleep] I iterally had 'no life'. I merely slept and worked and that was it. Now I have the baby, its difficult to sleep for very long periods and even if I did not have my stunning little boy I don't know how much longer I could go on feeling c**p all the time. I want to have energy and I want a life. My Mum helps with the baby and has him for me [work permitting] if I am having a really bad day but I want to be there for my son and not rely on her. More inportantly, it frightens the hell out of me that I am not alert and 'on the ball' or that I wont wake up if there is something wrong with him [I am a single parent - the baby's cot is in my room] or I will 'miss something' if he is ill and will fail to spot it. I am reluctant to go back to the gp because of the way they made me feel previously. I tried to purchase modafinil/provigil online but its not available without prescription and its very expensive. I would like to ask the GP to prescribe it, but I have a feeling that they wont without a diagnosis and will be reluctant to do so anyway because it costs a lot. Please, please does anyone have any advice, tips or anything would be so useful - I am desperate. Thank you for reading, sorry the post is so long.", "hash": "3e4beb5849f2fa3804817f1b9fa9f06f0785d1d1bf5e107feb6df1d3d96d1001"}

Also - as mentioned in the Not Mental book, even if you take \"enough\" B vitamins, some genetic glitches can hinder its usefulness and you might need methylated forms. That Provigil or Nuvigil really might help you get through the day while you search for the cause of your fatigue. I realize it is prescription, but the doctor can give it off-label for \"idiopathic hypersomnia\" which is what they call it when they don't know the cause. Warning - for some people a little is enough. For others, a little is like nothing. And for others, it can cause side-effects like headaches.

Since around high school, I have had trouble with feeling really tired during the day but I have always gotten at least 7-8 hours of sleep because I love sleeping. It seems like the only time I feel resfreshed at all is on my days off when I can get 9 or more hours of sleep. Sometimes I even operate better if I get less sleep but even though I feel more alert during the day, it begins wearing off at night and by the time it's near bedtime, I am slurring and stumbling like I'm drunk.

And I can't seem to keep my eyes open while driving. Everytime I blink my eyes seem to stay closed. I have frequent drymouth when I wake up and I often get headaches after sleeping or napping. I know it is supposed to get worse with age, but can it get worse if your life gets more stressful?

I am on quite heavy doses of psych meds but since starting work 5 weeks ago and working all hours of the day and night I have started to fall asleep while driving. My doctor has rushed my study forward to Thursday night so I'll let you know then if it's found I have sleep apnoea and to what degree. We should be coming into some tax money soon which I was hoping to put on a holiday but health is more important and in Australia the gear is like $2,000. I feel like 12hours sleep a night to feel rested and driving now even when awake is starting to trigger anxiety and thus depression which has been well controlled for the last few years so hopefully we'll find the answer shortly. Just from all the information I've read, you should use the machine every night unless you under go radical life changes and then you'd need to be re-tested to see if the sleep apnoea is still there as the most common form is an obstructive airway. -- Sat Jul 16, 2011 8:39 pm -- Finally got my results back I stop breathing on average 29 times an hour, no wonder I feel like crap. That does not allow you to get into a deep sleep which is needed to rest the brain allowing the body to be physically restored. Now I have to wait for a trial of a CPAP to see if that will help. Sleep apnoea is awful I never feel rested or have the energy to do anything, so then you feel guilty because nothing gets done and at work especially in my job mistakes can cost lives.", "hash": "b9420cfcfbc865ff06f9edc4bf6c853329f1249a183125c52febd1baa54d726e"}

So these people afraid to death to be alone. But there is one time a day that everyone gets alone, ant it's sleeping time. Even if we go to bed with our spouse, the time we close our eyes, we're alone and the only relationship we have is with ourselves. And that's exactly what a NPD person try to avoid all of his life. Having no other person to interact he run out of his own personality, his own ego, and this is equivalent in some way to death. So NPD's experience a fear of death when they have to go to sleep. Some of them try to work overtime, or try to sleep with the lights turned on, some experience nightmares.

I would guess he was a bed wetter sleep walker child and it was not handled well at the time. I am a former licensed psychologist with MS now, so I no longer practice, and I have no experience with sleep disorders anyway. I do have empathy for my tenant, however. I've been renting to him for 3 years. There are a number of facts and symptoms which point to trouble, which I really don’t want to be responsible for any more. I do remember seeing odd welts on his forehead when he first moved in. He asked to replace his carpets one time, as he claims they smelled (carpets were new). Later I found pet stain & smell remover spray under his sink (during repair). I had inquired as to his snoring like a freight train before his 1st renewal, and he moved his bed to another room. About at this time I became aware that noises at night were in reality his sleep walking, and they have been very loud and shocking from time to time when he falls or knocks something over (perhaps once a month). THUD WHAM BAMB at midnight! He drinks alcohol heavily when he gets home from work and until bed, (I see his trash). I would guess he believes it helps him sleep. He apparently does not realize it contributes to sleep walking plus urinating. Finally, he has a compulsive water usage problem also, sometimes flushing the toilet 6 times in a row. (I pay the water bill.) He fills 30 1/2 gal. jugs of water at a time (what for?) I have asked him if there is anything wrong with the toilet (he says no). Because he lives on the 2nd floor with a stairway leading down from the living room with no door or gate, I would have to guess this to be very dangerous in his situation. Renewal of the lease is coming in a couple months. I would like to treat him like an adult and do not want him to be vindictive. I’m sure he faced a lot of ridicule and discrimination as a child at camp and sleep-over time. He does not have a partner and spends almost all of his free time on internet games. Currently I am thinking about giving him the option to seek ongoing (provable) treatment in order to remain. Any hint of failed treatment that is not ongoing will violate terms of the new lease and he will be asked to leave. (failed treatment that is ongoing is OK) Perhaps he will leave now on his own, as I think avoidance has been his primary resolution strategy in the past. I am searching around the internet for a discussion group to get feedback, and found this one. What would you do?

For the past two years I've had a sleep issue. I, for a most part, get to sleep fairly quickly. No real problems there. The issue is once I've been asleep an hour or two I wake up. Now let me first explain something. I sleep on my right side because I have a frozen shoulder and cracked rib pain on my left. If I try to sleep on that side within ten minutes it hurts like heck and I have to roll over. Except I share a bed with my fiancé, and I can't sleep facing people, it feels too confined and stuffy. So I have to sleep on the right side of the bed so I can face outwards. When I wake up (on the right side of the bed) I, like most people, try to go back to sleep, I'm comfortable and warm and happy to go back to sleep. That's when my brain kicks in. I need to swap to the left side of the bed, I know it will hurt and I don't want to but if I don't I won't go back to sleep because that side of the bed is way more comfy than the side I'm on. So I rouse my fiancé (who is an insomniac and gets less than 4 hours of sleep a night normally...even before he met me and I went nuts with sleep issues) and we swap sides. Give it ten minutes for the pain to start (sometimes I fall asleep so it's another hour maybe) and I have to swap sides again. Give it another hour and I'm back to the left of the bed. This can happen six or more times a night. I try to not give in, I tell myself I won't swap sides...I don't sleep. At all. And all the time my brain is telling me that the other side of the bed is more comfortable, it's honestly driving me mad, I want to sleep properly and not disturb my fiancé so he can get more than a few hours sleep, I feel terrible because I haven't had a full nights sleep in two years and I tried to tell my doctor but she didn't seem to understand and assumed I meant I tossed and turned...I do, only ten times worse because I have to physically move to the other side of the bed. I don't know what to do any more I'm afraid my fiance will get sick of this (he says he won't but it doesn't stop me worrying) and leave so he can get a better nights sleep. What can I do?", "hash": "cac23c7563422243fe7c6c35fc2d53311c337c5e19302ab9e9026faf2b70e7d0"}

I am 30, I have 3 kids, and recently married their father (in Feb of this year).For as long as I can remember I have fallen asleep easily. Watching TV, movies...in class...even in the middle of band in High School I would fall asleep sitting in the chair, instrument in hand. It’s not that I *want* to I just can’t help it. In the last year or so I have been dealing with chronic feelings of being tired, no amount of sleep helps. I can go to bed as early as 8:30-9:00 sleep until 7am and still be tired. I don’t toss and turn, I don’t dream I just never feel rested. It has gotten to the point that I can be sitting at a table with friends playing a board game and drinking coffee...one moment i am awake and talking the next thing I know someone is waking me up. I fight all day to stay awake at work. I fall asleep eating..smoking...anything. While this may sound strange it has started to take a huge toll on my marriage. My husband will come to bed at night and try to wake me up (he works 2nd shift) and I wont even roll over. I may on occasion push him away but never anything more. He has even go so far as to wake me up with sex and even with that I wont wake up. So he thinks I am not turned on or please by him..and doesn’t understand I have no control over what is happening. It hurts his feelings and is to the point we fight about me falling sleep on the couch or anywhere else so much that we don’t even talk anymore. I have tried everything. If I am not standing up physically moving or working on something that requires my total attention at work 9 times out of 10 I will be asleep in less than an hour. My doctor has been no help and I don’t know what to do. I am looking at loosing my job, my husband..and if I fall asleep driving again maybe my life.

I've never heard of anything like this. I have had these problems probably since puberty, and I'm almost 30 now. - Once I am alseep, I sleep like the dead. However, it usually takes me hours to fall asleep. - Even after 8 hours of sleep I'm tired, but getting more sleep doesn't help. - Some days I come home and try to take a \"nap\"...and sleep for the next 12-16 hours. If I give the excuse of illness, I can sleep for a few days (getting up only occasionally) before finally getting restless. - Other days I simply cannot get tired. Sometimes I'll go weeks on 4-ish hours a night. - When given no schedule, I level out to 8-10 hours of sleep, from about 4am to 2pm. But that only seems to be out of outside necessity, not internal; like, gee, I should go to bed now I guess, not gee I'm tired. - No matter what time of the day I wake up, I generally don't feel \"awake\" until around 2pm. Is this some kind of delayed sleep disorder which I am just ignoring? Or does it sound like something else? (Also, why the heck haven't any of my doctors/therapists ever done anything about it?

Sleep disorders isn't really my 'area'. Having read your post, however, the first thing that comes to my mind is 'narcolepsy', but even then your symptoms don't perfectly match it. Narcolepsy - in my mind at least - is characterised by irregular sleep patterns and can include falling asleep 'anywhere', including while outside. In my viwe, there is a good reason behind sleep disorders though, and I always think of diet at first. If you take too much coffee, for example, then you'll get terrible sleep and will feel energetic, when in fact your cells are crying out for a good rest. Someone once said that drinking coffee constantly is like whipping a knackered/exhausted horsse during a horsse race. Other things that can cause problems include drugs (obviously), stress, etc. Let me know what you think.

I also watched a tv programme about sleep - think it was one of the BBC channels - they showed Dominik Diamond, a journalist and tv presenter trying to overcome his insomnia. He ended up sleeping at erratic times and then had enough sleep that day so couldn't sleep when he wanted to and then was exhausted the next day and so on... He did a video diary of Sleep Deprivation Therapy, where he was only allowed 6 hours, and needed to get up after time was up, even if he hadn't slept the whole time. Gradually he was allowed to go to bed earlier (no daytime naps no matter how tired he was) but the getting up time stayed constant. I think it worked although I fell asleep through the programme myself so not sure how much I missed! I would guess something like that would need to be done under medical supervision as lack of sleep carries its own risks, and would not be a bad idea to see a doctor anyway. I have also seen a lot about disturbed sleep patterns and depression, or depression treatments being used to cure sleep disorders, so the GP would be the first port of call for that.

I'm a college student, trying to save up some money for the summer, but also doing some volunteer work related to my career pursuit. Because this graveyard job is not full-time, I am working at another job a couple afternoons during the weekday as well, which starts at 2:30pm, but I can only get around 10 hrs/week at this day job. This job isn't bad at all, other than the graveyard part. When I applied for this job, this graveyard position was the only one available, however, so it definitely made sense to take it. I've always had sleeping problems, but only to a mild extent. The biggest problem was usually waking up tired, and desiring to sleep 10-12 hours/night. The other big issue was getting to sleep early; I'd often lay in bed struggling to fall asleep. But other than that, once I'd had fallen asleep, I could sleep pretty soundly. As I said, getting up was often the difficult part. Now that I stay up until 7am most nights, my sleep cycle has been completely screwed up . Ideally, I like to sleep after my shift at 7am until 2:15pm, or later if I don't have to work at my other job. However, I simply can't sleep soundly. I tend to wake up almost every hour . On my days off, due to sleep deprivation I've been trying to catch up on sleep by sleeping at a normal time, say 11pm. I want to hang out with friends these days so I try to sleep earlier. When I slept at 11pm, I woke up an hour and a half later unable to fall asleep again. Several hours of trying to fall asleep later, I finally decided to visit my girlfriend, who lives after two hours away. Unfortunately, I was tired the entire day. I spent the night over at her place and tried to sleep at 11:30am. I instantly fell asleep, but woke up at 3am, unable to fall asleep once again. This has been terrible, obviously detrimental to my health. Is there any way to sleep more soundly? Medications? etc. Even when I don't sleep \"early,\" I still wake up every 2-5 hours, not feeling rested.

I get maybe 5-7 hours per sleep on worknights, and then I sleep in on the weekends (Saturday and Sunday mornings). To make matters worse, I suspect I need more sleep than the average person since I'm an HSP (highly sensitive person) (see Elaine Aron PhDs books for more info on sensory-processing sensitivity). Anyway, if I quit this job and throw away my alarm clock, letting myself wake up whenever I want, will I still suffer any effects? I'm particularly concerned about the mental effects. According to a blog comment by someone named \"Daniel\" posted January 18th, 2010, \"Any hour less than 8 hours a day is a loss of 1 IQ point. A human can lose up to 30 IQ points in a single week by reducing his sleep to 4 hours per night. This will recover when going to normal sleep (8 hours) however.\" He never cited his sources or mentioned if he had any credentials, so I'm not sure if I should believe him. I'm on holidays now; the last day I worked was like June 5th. How many more days should I wait before my IQ has climbed back to normal? Or do I still have lost sleep to make up for? Or is it a lost cause and I should just take the IQ test as soon as possible because sleeping in on more days isn't going to change anything?", "hash": "5c98881a30407883c6181067baf06e548208d2d4053422be2939ea6d84d8141c"}

The author of the study probably only researched a small and biased sub-set of the popuulation, and therefore it would not be applicable to everyone. I also believe that there are much more productive ways through your current problems. For example, if you sleep 5-7 hours each weeknight, is that so bad? If you get sufficient rest at the weekend, then it should be okay. Long-term, however, you could look to move closer to your workplace (or apply for jobs closer to your current residence). I don't suggest leaving your current job and having nothing to do. Also, even if you did leave your job, I think that you would just wke up at the same time anyway. on the weekends, I ALWAYS weake-up at the time that I usually get-up on any weekday. The only difference is that I can just go back to sleep. The body learns what it's usual sleeping pattern is, and there are chemicals and signals that regulate it. So, when the weeekend comes along, the body just assumes that the usual pattern will continue, and you wnd-up waking up at the same time as you would get-up for work.

It has basically made the last 9 months for me a living hell. Severe neck pain and headaches, migraines...tiredness. Every day. Does anyone else have it? When I finally found out a name for clenching at night (or grinding, but I clench) I found out it was the third most common sleeping disorder....and many people have it, but very few actually know that they have it or have any symptoms. Anyway when it really dawned on me that my neck pain was caused from bruxism, and I basically wasted my summer going to chiropractors and all that jazz, I read about this device called the SleepGuard, which I promptly bought. I've had it for about a month and it is working, but I have still been having trouble with pain in the last few days...my neck seizes up a lot and is in so much pain...my boyfriend massages my neck so much its ridiculous. The pain bruxism creates prevents me from being productive and getting on with every day life. The SleepGuard is based on psychology, woohoo! Classic Conditioning, where, you train yourself to relax to a beep tone, so that when you wear it at night.....if you clench, it beeps, and you relax, and so you stop clenching. It records the times you clench and the total time you clench.

I remember hearing something about it in the news recently too, and indeed about how common it actually is. The problem with posting about it here though is - firstly - that this particular part of the website isn't too active. Secondly, not many people know what the word 'bruxism' means. You'd probably get more people reading your posts if you just called it 'sleep teeth grinding' or something similar. I think you might also get more/better help on websites devoted solely to sleeping problems. You're welcome to stay here if you want to though, as we cater fora whole range of issues as you can see.

When you hear voices or whispering or random noises or anything of that nature when you're falling asleep it's because you're experiencing the transition between being awake and going into sleep paralysis. This happens every time you go to sleep. It helps to prevent you from hurting yourself in a dream by closing down all motor skills except breathing. The voices you hear are just auditory hallucinations. They're nothing to worry about. And if you can ignore them for long enough you will slip into what is known as a lucid dream where you have complete control over the dream. I just want to repeat again, the sounds you hear are harmless and most often sound very vivid. Don't freak out! Lucid dreams are an amazing experience and it sounds like you would be a natural at Wake Initiated Lucid Dreaming (WILD). You should do some reading on it and experiment. It's something that doesn't come easy to most people.", "hash": "d7f286dfe6f512b03da7a4c174f050bf2c1f29ff1887740dcbb4ae13036945d4"}

Look at it this way though: A dream is just a collection of random thoughts in our heads, usually thoughts that have been on our mind recently. The mind does'nt really know what it's doing when we dream, and so thoughts can be 'grabbed' from anywhere in our brain. That's why they can seem so bizarre at times, scary at others, and funny at others. You're one is scary - no doubt about it - but it's not real. There's no way that' it is any indication of what might happen in the future. The next time that you have this dream, just forget about it and pass it off as silly.

What I meant was the sleep paralysis which I had occasionally my whole life, became really frequent when I decompensated and became really depressed. Decompensation does have other known psychotic sleep disturbances like extreme nightmares which I also had frequently, so why not sleep paralysis? Some weeks I felt worse and it happened more often, some I felt a little less bad and it happened less. All this was before I started on Wellbutrin which eliminated the paralsys entirely. You are of course right to be skeptical, but the medical community hasn't figured out everything yet either. I'm a scientist myself, and I'm not in the habit of chasing crackpot theories, but in this case I think I at least have enough evidence to consider it a rational possibility.

He has described it to me, and it sounds awful. What happens to him is that he will be asleep, and then his mind wakes up. when he tries to move his body, it won't move at all. You are able to raise your arm a little, but he can't move at all. This lasts literally 5 minutes. He sees a dark shadow/ghost like figure above him on the ceiling. One time, he saw hundreds of bugs crawling in just one corner of the room. He could see it, but when he tried to move, he couldn't. The ironic thing is that just last night before we went to bed, he told me he found out it was something called sleep paralysis. The next morning, I went to work, and he was asleep. He told me that the same thing happened to him again. This time, it was even more weird. He said that either he was dreaming, or actually doing it, but he supposedly walked to the front door, peeked through the hole, and went incredibly sleepy, and ran back into bed and fell asleep. On his way to the door, he saw something in front of him with a large sheet over it. It looked like a person under the sheet. He ran to it and grabbed it with his arms, but found out it was metal. This was obviously a dream because we don't have anything like that in our house, but it was just so weird. He said it felt so real. It's really scary. I think the best thing you can do is just research about it and find out as much as you can. He found out that it is not harmful at all, but I'm sure it doesn't seem like it at the time.

Once you enter sleep paralysis, just maintain consciousness and STAY CALM and before you know it, you will be in the dream world, usually through a false awakening. You'll think you're awake, but look at your alarm clock then look away and look back -- the time will be completely different! It may even display words instead!

I have a hard time explaining it to my T and nurse, because it changes often. I've had some med changes recently, quite a few of them actually, so maybe that is it? I was originally on trazodone, then it changed to ambien but insurance didn't cover it (ambien worked very well for me, it was amazing, but we couldn't afford it) and then I took temazepam but it didn't really help at all so about two weeks ago I stopped taking it and never refilled my script. Even though I wasn't taking a lot, only 12.5mg (sometiems 2 of them) of the temazepam each night, I think it might have something to do with this crap that's been happening. It has been reoccuring nightmares, usually 4-5 times each week for about the past 3 weeks, that has been driving me crazy lately, along with other things. On the nights that I don't have them, I won't have them at all, but the nights that I do, I usually wake up multiple times and fall right back into where it left off unless I get up and distract myself for a bit. Also I have been getting really itchy at night and I'll start burning up. Usually during the day I am exhausted, when I first lay down, I truely feel very tired. I'll usually lay there for about a half an hour, which is a BIG improvement compared to when it was 3-4 hours before. But now, I'll usually fall asleep fairly quickly and then after anywhere betweek ten minutes and a few hours I'll wake up suddenly, usually from what sounds like screaming in my head if it's been only a few minutes, or if it's been longer, usually a nightmare. It's not always bad dreams though, sometimes I just wake up. Immediately after I wake, I'll have, not really a burst of enerydy per se, but I usually sit up right away, and if I try to fall back asleep I can't and I usually will get up like I said earlier and find something to do. I just can't go back to sleep. Then I will do this over and over again all night. This is mixed in with me not being able to sit still. I feel like I have to move, I go from one side of the bed to the other, moving into different positions constantly. It feels like while doing this, I am half sleeping, half awake. I don't always know what is real. I hear people screaming and see patterns in the lights. I get twitches and start talking aloud to myself to try to calm myself down, I think I am going crazy. I seriously question my sanity at night. I am so afraid that I am going to fall into a bad dream and never get out. I don't know. Maybe this is just stress, my life has been kind of messed up lately. For me in the past, sleep and marijuana were the only two things that I really enjoyed, I loved both of them, it was where I could escape from the daily BS I put up with and could relax and just feel good. Just laying there. I had to stop smoking first because of the meds, and then because of a job, and I stopped for months. I had no problem doing this even after smoking on a daily basis for quite some time. So now the only good thing I had has been taken from me. So because I no longer am on any meds and won't be drug tested , I am thinking about smoking again. I think it might help. My T reccommended a sleep study, so that should happen in the next few weeks hopefully. But til then I don't know what to do. I think I might refill the temazepam and see if that might help. Anybody have any thoughts on this? Any suggestions?", "hash": "87ea34d0224f44ccd0c00c183393666da41d97f74b17c27a983520a46cfd6ccf"}

Bruxism usually occurs during sleep. Bruxers (persons with bruxism) are often unaware that they have developed this habit, and often do not know that treatment is available until damage to the mouth and teeth has been done. However, each individual may experience Bruxism symptoms differently. Bruxism is due to clenching of the teeth other than in chewing and is associated with forceful lateral or protrusive jaw movements. This results in grinding or rubbing the teeth together. Children with bruxism usually stop grinding their teeth before adulthood. However, bruxism can affect adults for an indefinite period of time. More often, psychological bruxism causes includes: Suppressed anger or frustration Aggressive, competitive or hyperactive personality type Anxiety, stress or tension Bruxism self care steps given fellow may prevent or help treat bruxism limit alcohol, tobacco and caffeine reduce stress, consult your sleep partne, have regular dental exams Some more useful resource to help you out from all kinds of sleep disorders A Guide To Brusim", "hash": "57a28e0def602f8d60735ccde8ce30d4cc1c8e133714e0ec38cb271653514b32"}

I have terrible troubles getting to sleep, and overall, I don't feel that the sleep I do get is restful, at all, considering I'm ALWAYS (well, most of the time) tired. When I go to bed, almost every night, i seem to start drifting to sleep, then, I'm not sure if i fully fall asleep, or are just half asleep, I jerk awake really quickly, more wide awake then I was before I went to bed. Also, I get really, really hot and uncomfortable. I figure this part is from a boost in metabolism in the same context as the 'fight-or-flight' reaction from the CNS. Any ideas? Thanks.

If you said it’s a southern rock band then you are correct. But this article is about rapid eye movement, REM. Much of our memorable dreaming takes place during what is known as REM sleep. REM is a sleep stage that is marked by movements of the eye behind the closed eyelids. Accompanied by the appearance of characteristic rhythms in the brain’s electrical activity. There are 4 stages of REM sleep. The first stage takes place about 90 minutes after you fall asleep and last for approximately 5 minutes. Three of four further periods of REM sleep occur during the night at intervals of about 90 minutes, each lasting longer than the previous one. The last period of REM sleep usually occurs one hour before you awake. REM sleep is where you dream……… Do you ever wake up in the morning and say, “ I had a strange dream or a bad dream ”. Or maybe you had some prophetic dreams or a digital dream. Scientific research indicates we can remember about 80 percent of each dream episode if we are awaked immediately after its completion. But this drops to about 30 percent with in the next eight minutes or so and then rapidly declines to about five percent. Next time you have a dog dream, a hair dream, a vista dream or maybe even a green dream grab a piece of paper and pen when you wake up from the dream. Make notes of the dream and any type of dream symbols that occurred. While scientists generally agree that the process of dreaming is important, many of them believe that the content is valueless. However, the coherence of much dream material and the existence of recurring dreams, which repeat themselves over many years, would suggest otherwise. The appearance in dreams of memories from long ago and the proven therapeutic value of dream interpretation, confirm that the dreaming mind can give us valuable guidance. http://www.dream2see.com", "hash": "674a44b20bc9e619b401944e73650765539b065cfb6f1762b8493df8a47495a6"}

Dreams are just a mixture of random thoughts pulled together into one - that's why they can seem so weird sometimes. They mean absolutely nothing. If anything, dreams just tell us what has been on our minds recently, nothing more. Kevin", "hash": "8414da7c96900413f19fe104c9fac263d2b38eec669f50eace27f2a4935eb1d8"}

I do some odd behaviors in my sleep. The first thing is hitting. For some reason while I’m sleeping I reach out and punch my wife in the back. If she isn’t there or I’m on my other side I usually hit the wall several times and very hard. Sometimes I have dreams of hitting someone but most of the time I have no memory of anything. The next thing is masturbation. My wife says that on a few occasions she has been woken up by me masturbating quite heavily and very fast. My wife said that she tied to stop me and that I got violent when she tried to hold me or move my hands. She has said that I don’t speak coherently it is really more moaning and mumbling. The other thing is talking. My wife is not the first to mention this I was told by my comrades in the army and my mother. The talking ranges from yelling and screaming to very quite mumbling and weeping. People have said sometimes it’s a word here and there other times I carry on conversations.
