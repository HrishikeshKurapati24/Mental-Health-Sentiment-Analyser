1,3,"Hi, im refusing to go to at the moment work. I took a sick leave and went to the doctor. She gave 3 more weeks, talked about that how bad is there. At the moment I have already been away for 12 days. Im exhausted also, having 5 years there.

The job is easy, customer service in dry cleaning. I accept clothes and laundry. I will make a receipt, then its all. Mostly thats all. Sometimes theres paperwork and any other doings but it's rare. I can use computer also after that co-worker leave.

BUT the person who im working is terrible. She is mostly on computer doing things. While the customer coming, she knows everything, wants to add to the story herself and want to serve herself, sometimes leaves herself to bring the customer things, because she knows what kind of customer is she/he.  In a while ago she trusted me task, but doing it herself next day from her day-off. And also wrote note that Iihave something unmarked in the plan.

In another shift (im used to there if someone ill or in a holiday), im having also bad co-worker. For example one day after my shift she asked how i received these things (like med coats). And I understood that she checks the work rather than noticing mistakes. Started to say:  you been working there a long time, if u do mistakes a company will suffer financial loss. You can send messages or call. Not that u dont like, nobody cares that. Then i said you been very bad to me earlier, i dont want to contact with you. Then she said she dont feel sorry, but mistakes u do you need to learn about it. And please dont call me or write me, its a mental terror from u. It happened during the month.

And i had problems with them everytime i came to work. I just suffered with some reasons that place, for example i had people there who i used to talk and i had another life, but its over now.

What u guys recommend me? :/ 

Its a monotony work, besides these people. I dont feel im having there nobody. Only one person, but she got part-time job and she is very old person.

2,3,"I just got a job 3 months ago and one thing i always struggled with is explaining people what i want to convey and it happeend in this job as well. When my senior asked me what i wanna get done i am unable to tell him my issue i am stuck on and just time waste both his and mine and i cant understand his solutions either today was one of those days where i got a deadline and ofc nobody works good in pressure.   
I was supposed to make some reports by EOD and hop onto a google meet to present my report and continue with future action plans but i am unable to cause i wasnt able to understand what my senior wanted even after multiple calls and 1:1 screen sharing with him. But i kept messing up i hate myself feeling so shit about myself today. My senior also just straight up said to me to not join the meeting he will handle everything on my behalf and make the reports by himself.

I hate myself and i feel like really stupid rn i would really appreciate someone to talk to rn about my day and let my stress out"
3,3,"I recently took a job as a consultant. It has been a couple of months since and they have checked my interest for a full-time role but no concrete offer yet. But I have dealing with different sets of issues and I am unclear on how to deal with this. Any advice would help.

1. My boss is a workaholic and works even on sundays and expects the same from me. Even though its only for a few hours, still it's not a clean break for me. He also expects me to send mails to agencies we work with on weekends. I feel very uncomfortable with this.
2. Even for tiny errors on my part in my deliverables, his feedback is extremely harsh.
3. The old members of the team keep telling me very unsettling things about how he is not nice to you, the second he is unhappy about the way you're handling things at work
4. I was laid off a few months back and after that I chanced upon this role. Now I am extra nervous with any kind of critical feedback because the fearing of losing a job again stresses me out and I am also overworking myself in the hope that they will make me permanent.

What advice would you have for someone in this position."
4,3,"I am dealing with super high anxiety.. I do not have many years work experience and the industry that I am currently working is quite new and still start-up. So far, I had very poor managerial input in terms of procedures etc.. I am setting up a laboratory almost alone by buying equipment and trying to figure out what I need for the analytical test I will be doing. Apart from this stress I am dealing also with an autoimmune disease (Hashimoto's), PCOS and feeling completely stupid an incompetent at work. The stress just leads to more flare ups.Sometimes I do have the feeling that colleagues believe I am stupid and this makes me even more sad. I do not know how to handle this situation. Does it make sense to share these with the HR ?"
5,3,"Sorry for the long rant....I didn't realise it will be this long when I first start typing it out.  
  
Hi, 38(F) here. After graduating from high school, I worked part time at this huge corporate company and during an event where I was the emcee, the chairman noticed me and offered me a scholarship to pursue my degree, while I was studying, I still continued to work part time there for all in all 7 years. After graduating with first class honours, I continued to work for said corporate company for another 7 years. During my tenure, I gradually climbed the ladder and eventually was promoted as the head of department. However, there was a change of management and things started to go haywire. I realise that whatever the new management have in mind for the future of the business unit does not align with my vision. There was a lot of scheming and 'unethical' practices that was geared towards their own personal selfish gains that I couldn't compromise. When I went against those practices, I was even reported to the chairman's office (yes, the same chairman that offered me the scholarship) probably for being 'difficult' or 'insubordination'. I was in line to be 'interrogated'. But when the bosses saw how unafraid I was and was thoroughly prepared with all evidence to show the chairman, they somehow convinced the chairman to delay and eventually cancel the meeting. Well, after that incident & also struggling with emotional burnout from work, I decided to resign.

Sick of all the politics and drama of a huge corporate company, I choose to move to a way smaller company that is in a similar field with a pay cut & demotion to assistant manager in hopes that I can sustain a more peaceful career. Things were vastly different here especially in the management system aspect, but I adapted pretty quickly and settled in. I am now almost 4 years in, I have been promoted to manager & head of department to general manager of one of the business units since then. Sounds great right? Well, I expected less drama, but turns out there are more here! As we are a small team and have direct access to the CEO, and some of the main positions are held by his wife and family members, the dramas are closer than ever. Initially I was excited to help the company achieve growth and hopefully to bring up the standards overall. However, I find that most managers are walking on eggshells around the boss' family members, they (and myself included) do not have empowerment and whatever decision that we make can easily be rejected/reprimanded if one of the family members do not agree with it. The CEO is not a bad person, but he has a bad habit of listening and changing his mind base on who is close to him during that time. Mostly new recruits that tries hard to kiss his ass. In my 4 years here, most of these new recruits do not last more than a year although when they first join, the boss would sing praises about them & they can never do anything wrong. Those that have worked for a long time before me would be neglected and be picked on the 'things that they didn't complete'. If you have worked with a small company before, you will understand that you will have to multitask like SUPER a lot, due to lack of manpower and resources. So eventually, all these new 'favourites' always leave the company intensely (24hours notice, sue threats, etc) after a huge argument with the boss, and often times I have to deal with the aftermaths of their fallouts. Needless to say, I am totally burnout, I cannot concentrate on the work that matters, I feel like a failure (being an overachiever, I still compare myself to my peers, although I try not to), I want to try to help the company, but I surely DO NOT see a future in it if the boss doesn't change his management ways. Recently in the last 5 months, once again, the boss has a new favourite that has caused the resignation of 2 of my main managers because she has manage to manipulate boss to think badly of them. Somehow, I am beginning to think I am next in line although I sense she is treading carefully on this. Maybe deep down she knows I can be ruthless and she will never be able to do what I can do (I have a very specific degree in healthcare and she is in sales) so she is still trying to butter me up. I am tired of this, I know I am capable of being the largest asshole if I want to and create havoc but I also know I won't be able to sleep at night if I blow things up. I just want to work peacefully where I can help a company to grow and achieve its goals...so ya, any advice? I have contemplate in quitting, but I do not have anything solid planned for my next source of income. Good thing is, I am married with no children but I am caring for my parents, so although I can afford some sort of income adjustments, but eventually I would need a stable income. My field is very specific and there is not a lot of job opportunities unless I am willing to move states. I feel so screwed, help!"

7,3,"Turn up first thing he complains about how we left the kitchen yet he sets no example during the time. I had enough when he openly tells me he under appreciates me and his other half tells staff in a meeting I have to put up with him it’s a bad look. I point out all the times I fix shit he leaves including when he unplugs a fridge for his phone charger. And he just points out how amazing he has organised the fridges and that I have to do the same. But best bit is he does that on the day we are closed and daytime we are closed yet I’m to follow that during my sixth and last shift at the end, after already serving food. He also says I’m to manage the staff more to help if it’s too hard to which I point out that’s literally his job. He is a hypocrite and impossible to argue with when I try making a point he just says you always argue back but enough was enough. Sadly he won’t change he just knows we have big tables coming up which he needs me for and will go back to full arsehole mode when winter hits I’m sure "

9,3,"I work at an intentional community for adults with mental illness. I am currently in an area where I work in a basement with a toxic supervisor. I have the opportunity to switch and I applied and got the position in another area with the same job. Now I am hearing that the supervisor of that area is just as bad and he has expressed that he doesn’t really want me there. The transition is already in place. All supervisors have had a meeting about it and I have a date that I will move to the different area. It will be about 6 weeks from now. I am worried that if I don’t switch I will be retaliated against and treated as a flight risk. I am worried that if I do switch, it will be the same problems but in an unfamiliar area. Can I talk to HR and stop the transfer? I will be so embarrassed but will it be worth it to just stay?

For context: I am a really hard worker. It’s a difficult place to work and rumors spread fast so everyone already knows about the switch. "

13,3,"Hi everyone,

I've recently joined a company in the UAE as a Project Engineer, but they're treating me more like a Project Manager. The projects I'm involved in are already halfway through their timelines—one is a two-year project and the other a one-year project. I've been here for just a month, and I'm finding it challenging to catch up on everything.

The management is very demanding and not receptive to the fact that I need more time to fully understand these projects. They insist on involving me in every management meeting with the clients, and I often don't feel confident answering their questions due to my limited knowledge.

Additionally, even though they're considering me as a Project Manager, I'm still being asked to handle small tasks typical of a Project Engineer. This leaves me with little time to assess the overall status of the projects.

I need expert advice on how to navigate this situation. How can I balance these responsibilities and gain the confidence to manage client interactions effectively? Should I say to my management something?

TIA"

16,3,"Hi everyone just putting this out there because I had a bad experience at work and I can’t get it out of my head.

Im writing it here cuz I have no friends with me in this place. I came as an international student here so it’s just me here all my family and friends are back at home. Anyway I couldn’t understand a what the visitor who came to the place wanted and I assumed he needed something else which was my fault as I got nervous and didn’t handle the situation well. He then didn’t say anything left and came back again and said that I don’t understand what he is saying therefore he wants to speak to a nurse so I did as i told. 

I wanted to apologise but at that moment it felt if I did I would make it even worse. I understand why he got frustrated and I know that I need to listen.

But that moment is not getting out of my head and these stuff can really put me down.

18,3,"Hello, 

Fairly new job (less than a year) and the environment has been good, and low stress for the most part although at times can be high which is nothing I can’t handle. 

Hired this new girl who has only worked there for 3 weeks and only supervising 2 people me being one. She has been behaving very condescending almost all week, and she was gaslighting me which resulted in the manager apologizing to me and saying he’s going to make some changes but not sure when. The entire office is uncomfortable around this new girl which will affect production and overall well being. 

In the meantime, she’s talking to me and my colleague like we’re children (I’m over 40) and trying to pressure us to do more work than we can handle. The office manager has no issue with our productivity and everyone can see we are doing multiple things. I am doing my due diligence but she is hostile and it’s all about her and can care less about anything else. This is a trigger for me because I’ve worked for supervisors like this which resulted in me dreading going to work every day. I have PTSD and now I’m getting anxious going to work in the morning not knowing what mood and will be in or what she will complain about that “we’re not doing good enough” she keeps repeating instructions like we’re in preschool and I am considered mid to senior level in my industry. I don’t need anyone to hold my hand but I also don’t want someone ridiculing me and breathing down my neck. 

How would you handle this? There’s no use talking to her because I’ve tried and she is not aware of her behavior or just doesn’t care how she is talking disrespectful. I overheard her say she is just direct. BS "

20,3,I’ve been at my job for almost 4 years. Pretty much have loved the job and have always gotten great reviews from my managers. I was even promoted within a year of me being there and have gotten multiple raises. Within the past 6 months I was put under a new direct manager and everything changed. She pretty much is constantly on my ass and makes me feel like my team is the worst team. She told me today my team is making me look bad. Ever since being under her I am under constant stress and just feeling like I could lose my job at any moment. I am going to start looking for another job but right now the market is horrible and it would be so hard to find a job making what I make now. I also can’t afford to make less with my bills and being a single mom living on my own. I just cry everyday. I don’t know what to do.

**Update:** Using the Solh App for a while now. It has a mood meter which prompts upon opening of the app and provide mood analytics after days of use. This one is really helpful as this report is also somehow sharable to the manager not individual mood but they can see a overall team's mental health state. We have given mental health workshops and got some personal time with counselors for few minutes too. The workshops have actionable and practical approaches for balancing work and life. **I personally liked the Program.**"

23,3,"

A couple weeks ago I reported a coworker for harasmment, she called me up twice to berate me and then she sent me a scathing 10 sentence paragraph email telling me how bad of a worker I am and how I am letting the whole team down. Each time I asked her to stop and even asked my supervisor to please tell her to leave me alone but she wouldnt. HR decided to write me up for reporting it. I confronted HR and my manager, told them that they were gaslighting me and showing favoritism cus this other agent has been with them longer, while down playing her offenses.

They decided not to write me up because they said I didn't know that older agents could (micromanage, bully and harass) “help” newer agent. I have been working here for 9 month and never had another agent even talk to me about a file I worked let alone yell at me about it. To top it off they called me agressive 7 times because I calmly but firmly told the girl you are not my manager I am terminating the call and I am contacting my supervisor and hung up. Imagine getting in trouble for seting a boundary! I told HR that being assertive and settinf a boundary is not the same as being agressive. HR said be ause it was send in an email she couldnt say that it was agressive but when I sent her a message to pleass not to speak to me like that again they said that was agressive. I ended up having a couple panic attacks and had to take time off of work. I still have not recovered. "

Hi readers, I have a situation🤔: 

I work in a tech company and have worked there for 3 years now and currently in an hybrid structure 🚗🏠

I have asked my 2 Managers that I would need 2-3 months off for my Indian wedding as I have to travel to India 🇮🇳from US🇺🇸. It’s in Dec 2024 (this year) and I am planning my trip from Oct 2024 - Jan 2025. 

And they said that I could take as many days off as I want just let them know about it. They seem to be  cool now but I am worried about it going diff way. 

but I am having some concerns regarding this situation: 

1) Should I take full 3 months off? 🤷‍♀️

 If so, would they take me back once I return? 🛬

2) Should I do 1 month or several weeks of remote work from India to secure my current position? 🔒

3) What else should I do to ensure that my position is secured even though take 3 months off? 🙇‍♀️"
25,3,"Hey guys, I’m working a new position in my company and I need some objective feedback. What do you think about a boss that gives assignments but doesn’t let you finish them? Like you’re literally in the middle of doing the job and the boss calls and says you’re taking too long, what’s going on? He does seem to understand that not every task can be done on n 5 minutes. This is very stressful and happens every day, he blames me for stuff not getting done but I can’t do 8 tasks at once. Thoughts?"
26,3,"So. I’m 19. I’m an adult. Have been for a year I guess. Graduated last school year. And I have yet to get a job that I have kept for longer than a few days, because my depression makes me want to straight up ram my head into a wall into everything is black. I can’t work a job I don’t care about. I can’t. And the only reason I am still eating is because my mother is being gracious with me until January. January is coming quick, and I am no closer to knowing what to do. I don’t know what steps to take, and looking for any information online is basically bogus. I was never forced to do things I didn’t want to as a child, and despite growing up poor and in a uniquely rough situation, I got none of the grit, discipline, or work ethic that came with such a upbringing. Now I’m an adult who has literally no marketable skills, who is too depressed and lazy to work the jobs that are available at my skill level without wanting to actually off myself."
27,3,"I’ve been with the company for five months. One of my projects they put me in charge of was used as training for a software. 

Basically, I’d do what my boss asked as she would observe on a big screen. I did this task about 8 times, again with her observation. Turns out there was a huge mistake in all of them. Someone tried to tell her, she didn’t understand it so she ignored it. I understood the issue but because she seemed to make it seem like no big deal and only one person was complaining about the mistake, I figured my team was in the right. 

Nope. 

It turns out, yes, a huge mistake was made. And it’s my project, my responsibility things go right, so my fault. And they never let me forget it, meaning they still seem super upset about it. I can’t ask questions about parts of the project, because my boss will just vaguely state I should already  know it. If I ask something to a co worker, they ask why didn’t I ask the question sooner. At one point, one co worker literally laughed at me because I still need to ask questions. So yeah, my boss already hinted about firing me. I’m trying to be as open as possible what I’m doing to see if maybe there’s a part I’m not seeing, but I just get ignored. Another co worker argued with me about my park job? Still not sure what that’s about. 

I still try to see what else I can in lag periods and if they tell me nothing, the next day I missed something really big and obvious. 

I just feel really sad and stupid."

for anyone whose advice is that i should quit right now, i can't. i have way too many responsibilities at the moment.

idk what to do. i just don't want to be here anymore."
38,3,"After a few days working the store front my anxiety had been so elevated, and I’ve found it’s been getting easier but dealing with rude customers is the worse, any tips?"
39,3,"When I got this job, I thought that I have a great decision in life. Then I was so nervous in my first day, like you don't know anyone and everything is so new. But I got one of the workers who just like me is a new hired but the difference was they know her. So she immediately got closed with those people. my vibe in working is first to get along with my co-workers so everything smooths and no problem at all. Second, to work and work. 

Before everything else, the other work( ex-worker who just resigned wants to work again in this kind of company but i got her spot) so yeah, not my fault at all. Back to the story, Things were not okay cause I wasn't sure how to interact with my new workmate. I tried but I'm not a people pleaser and if you don't like me okay. It doesn't bother me. 
 
It's okay that they don't like me, it's just don't talk behind my back or always checks me from head to foot. Cause i hate it. So yeah, moving on. I just minding my business and i work and work but one day, the company got this meeting and i got this feeling that is not right. That this Effin meeting got to do with me, and my gust got it right. Someone was complaining about my work for days or weeks and nobody confronts me. Like WTF, they totally told me to treat everyone like family and if any problem comes we need to help one another. But NOBODY IN THE COMPANY TOLD ME ABOUT THIS! like i greet them well with happy face but now they just attack me like this? Wow!

I felt like I got ambush with these people in front of our supervisor. Like damn! Instead of cursing them, I just smile and zip my mouth cause if I talk I don't know what will words im gonna say that i dont wanna regret it later.

Time passed by and I just observed my workmates. They have their judgement eyes in me and what so ever. I told my mom about this cause its stressing me out. Like if i got another mistake no one gonna defend me or in my side . This shit really scares me cause im just a human and i could make a mistake. And I cried cause of it, but then I just stop to do things to make them accept me. Like I don't give a give F with them. 

Then one day, one of my coworker told me about the person who complained about my work was the ex co worker who want to work again in the company. I don't know what's with her but it really hurts me cause when i saw her in the company i greeted her with a smile and she to me. Like damn! What did I do to u girl? Oh hate this kind of dirty move.

I always saw my workmates having bffs within them but I don't have one like hahahaha what a loner. But I don't care. I just learned that there are people will not like you, no matter how hard you try. And it's okay, you don't have to please them. 

So now, I work so so hard that I feel like I'm the secretary of the boss but no I'm not. Every workload was put into me and i have to work extra extra time for that to finish and if the result is failure well, im the one whose totally fucked up. Just me. Like WTF. Even i got sick i need to go to work cause no one will handle the project and no one will help me. 

And now that, i got passed on some exams. The supervisor always asked me if we should hire the ex worker. And the other workers too was asking when I will be out of the company. Like can't you all shut uo and wait for me to pass my resignation letter. Like damn, i know you don't like me but please let us be professional. 

Okay, bye"
40,3,"It's been a little over 24 hours since I resigned from the senior-level career position that was killing me mentally and destroying my health. The last two Fridays, I suffered from intense panic attacks and endless anxiety. I left the house to get away from knives. I took walks to avoid continuing to research how to end my life. I let my employer ultimately defeat me. I questioned if I was weak for not being able to handle it. I questioned if I was foolish for walking away without a plan. Even now, I’m terrified, but this fear is light-years better than night terrors, insomnia, suicidal ideations, endless medication, and the desperate desire to die.

I’m still gravely depressed. And I have a lot of healing ahead of me. But if I was drowning, I finally feel like I made it to the surface. I can breathe. I’m still in the water, I’m still rather lost, but I see the light.

I can’t tell anyone reading this to quit their jobs. I can reassure you that work trauma is real. Work abuse (even emotionally) is real. And yes, an employer can lead you to suicide. I wish I had opened my eyes a year ago this time. I hope this inspires someone to bet on themselves.

If you quit abruptly without a plan please share your story. It may save a life."
41,3,"I will try to make this as short as possible so here goes,

I recently turned down a job with normal Monday-Friday 9a-5p hours for a few reasons. One was that the benefits at my current job are much better. Another reason was because I wouldn't have made a consistent amount of money as it is very client based and if the client cant make a session, I would get paid much less. 

This could be anywhere from 500+ dollars less to 200 more than what I make now. And thats with no overtime at my current job as well as with the highest rate offered at the company. After talking with an employee that works there they make about what I make (on average) getting paid the highest rate.

I probably could have made this work but without a garunteed base pay, I could not accept making what could end up being 500+ less some months as I am single and pay everything solo. Ive crunched the numbers alot and could end up just paying bills some months with no extra money to save or spend. I lived like that last year around this time and don't want to do it again. Its just more comfortable to know what I am making rather than having that much variation in pay plus the opportunity for overtime where I currently am gives me the possibility to make more to save up for vacations or whatnot.

Currently I work mostly 2nd shift with rotating weekends(day shift), where I have Mondays and every other Friday off when I work the weekend. Its not a bad gig, its just the schedule gets to me. Dont get me wrong I have plenty of time off but its not alot of ""quality time"" off. 

Everyone else is at work when Im off in the mornings and in bed by the time I'm off. Fridays off are cool but still most people are at work til 5p-6p then when I work Saturday morning I dont want to be out too late When I am off the weekends, I really only have like half a day Saturday and all day Sunday. I'll work til 11pm Friday night which makes me tired and sleep in til 10am Saturday and it'll be noon by the time I am ready to do anything. Im just at the age where all my friends are or are getting married so the little social time I would have is even less. Not to mention trying to date is impossible. It's been a year since I've been on a date and a very long time since its gone past that. Trying to find time to meet up was extremely hard. I guess Im more or less venting to anyone who has read this far or people in my position"
42,3,"So in the last 2 weeks i had to work 12 days consecutively, all of them starting at 7 am, and most of them up till 5 pm (9hours + 1hour break). I'm only 23 so not a huge amount of experience, so nothing like this has ever happened before.  


after working for 7 days straight already, the assistant manager asked me a fairly simple thing, but because i was dead tired (and still am as i'm typing this, coming back from work after having a breakdown) i interpreted it wrong and did something different. I go back and tell her that whatever she asked me was already fixed, so it seemed to me. at that she found it appropriate to say ""OP, sometimes you're dumber than a fucking cow's ass"" to me in front of 2 colleagues and a client.  


I didn't know what to say and once home i sent the manager a text asking if we could talk about what AM said and did. So we did, i told her my opinions about AM how she's only eating and on her phone, when the manager isn't here she does absolutely nothing and slides every task she gets to someone else, bullying and insulting colleagues.  


9th day of me working consecutively and i misplaced a couple pallets on the parking lot out back, but i was gonna come back to that to clean that up. AM sees it and finds it fitting to yell at me, again, in front of clients and colleagues ""OP, it's clear you got no fucking experience driving a car"" after that she berates me as we walk out back and instead of asking ""could you please move them"" she yells ""they better be moved when i get back"" after which she entered her car and drove off the parking lot without any issue whatsoever.  


Today, day 12, last day. Tired beyond anything, most my colleagues feel sorry for me and understand that i'm not as cheerful and enthusiastic as i usually am, bags underneath my eyes.  


2 other colleagues find it fitting to come and pick me out the moment i get on the work floor. i didn't even have time to get changed or they started already, saying i'm useless and that it's real easy what i do. i first say ""oh go away, i'm dead tired, i don't need this right now"" after which they continued i told them to F off. this got me super pissed, one of the two continued and kept saying i'm doing nothing or whatever tasks i do, i do them slow because i'm lazy. I tell AM that she either tells those two to have a bit of respect for me or i'm going back home.  


She goes to talk to them, i'm<still super pissed and tired and make a few dumb mistakes. she comes out back yelling at me that i need to calm down or else she's going to call the big boss, at which i said ""go ahead"" because i got stuff on AM i need to tell the boss as well.  


after an hour, and more remarks from the 2 bully colleagues AM flips again, i stay silent and calm, finish my task and go to the break room where i just start crying. AM tells me to go home.  


In my eyes it seems that AM is fine with bullying in the workspace. I'm so done with her and hope she gets a good talking from the big boss. the fact that i got sent home after, in my opinion, doing nothing wrong except getting angry, and those two bullies together with AM are still there makes it clear that i need to find a different workspace."
43,3," Have you ever come across situations in life when annoyance and irritability overpowered your fragile Mental Health?

Maybe you had a bad day in the office where the boss irritated you, your team member shies away from his responsibility and you feel overwhelmed and fully out of control?

These small issues and many more like these can rob your inner peace and happiness. So, now what can you do to restore your mental health and feel in tune with yourself?

You can learn to control your emotional responses through a self-help training skill known as **Emotional Mastery**.

**What Exactly Is Emotional Mastery?**

Emotional mastery means being in a state of awareness and acceptance of the way you feel. It refers to a gradual and slow process of controlling and conquering negative emotions that slowly leads to feelings of being overwhelmed and jittery.

In this process, you will not allow your feelings to overpower you. Being in control of your emotions cannot happen suddenly.

It is a process of identifying, controlling, and using your overwhelming feelings in positive ways to develop good relationships and effective communication with others.

Emotional mastery helps in diffusing conflict. It gives you inner peace and happiness like never before. The process helps to reduce everyday stress as you are no longer the victim of your overwhelming feelings.

**5 Techniques of Emotional Mastery**

These techniques are actionable ways that you can incorporate into your daily life to triumph over your negative emotions.

1. Identify your feelings and let them flow in and out as it is. Acceptance is the first step towards mastery.

2. Appreciate and embrace your emotions as a part of you. Without emotions, your life is meaningless. They are the flavor and color that define your existence.

3. Approach your emotions with a sense of curiosity. Try to pay attention to what these emotions are telling you. Acknowledge your feelings whether good or bad as authentic and meaningful.

4. The most powerful way to master emotions is by remembering a previous situation where you have handled a difficult emotional surge in a healthy way. By this, you gain the confidence of handling similar situations successfully now and in the future as well.

5. Celebrate your small success stories where you have controlled your annoyance, anger, and fear in a healthy way without getting overwhelmed. In doing so, you gather more courage and confidence to master emotions in troubling times as well.

**To Sum Up**

Emotions are an integral part of being human. Thus, cultivating emotional mastery helps to use your feelings in healthy ways so that life becomes all the more beautiful. You should not allow emotions to use you. This life skill is an essential ingredient for achieving your dreams and goals.

45,3,"So I’m not exactly sure how to improve my Temper at work, because I have built a short temper over a few years. My relationship has been a huge part of my Stress , and I feel it releasing on my work when I’m away from home. I tend to swear a lot more at work, and give bad attitude to my co workers I do notice the energy at work is very hostile with me when it comes down to time consuming projects. I work with Residential Electrical and to get the same answer from our boss is just getting to a breaking point for me. 
“I thought you be done by now with all the time given” or “hurry up finish up already “ when you are busting your ass off already as Is. it’s more for me to know how to manage that anger that comes out when I don’t have those chances of getting a lot of patience to put it somewhere else. Instead I’m over here abruptly getting pissed off, chewing it out with some co workers just cause they did it a certain way. But then I’m the one getting completely hot headed while everything is okay in the end, while implementing stress on me like that.

47,3,"So I've been working this job for about 3 years. The pay is good, and the majority of my coworkers are great. It's a restaurant, and it's been growing a lot especially in the last 18 months. I specifically work in the kitchen. For the longest time it was just me and one other employee who did kitchen shifts. But the last year we have gotten so busy that we both are needed for weekend shifts, and now we definitely need two people working even weekday shifts. We'd been begging them to hire someone else to help cover some shifts for about a year, and they finally did about two months ago. I also recently got a promotion, and was being shifted to more prepping than cooking. Which I was happy about, because I enjoy it more. The other part of the shop is coffee, and they kind of run through employees. Like at the end of summer last year 3 people put their 2 weeks in, on the same day. And we have a ton of new employees and people are getting unhappy again. Including us in the back. I am usually scheduled about 35 hours a week, but more often than not I'm working 40+ hours a week. The biggest issue are the owners. I think when the business was smaller, they were so good at running it. But it is expanding fast and they are even opening a new location soon. The employees are all worried that they are biting off more than they can chew, and it's causing them to be grumpy and mean consistently. One of the owners pretty much now lashes all their questions out. And the other one can say some pretty demeaning stuff, and ask questions that just make you tilt your head and say ""Did they really ask me that?"". The two of us in the back had a good relationship with them, but for some reason in the last month things went really down hill. We have no idea why. We left to go on a trip they knew about for 8 months. Before the trip they sit us down and have this huge talk with us, said they thought of us as family. And we thought everyone was on the same page when we left. Also we made sure to double prep everything that could be done, so that everything went smooth while we were out of the kitchen. According to all our other employees they didn't have to prep anything, aside from stuff that needs to be prepped morning of. Everything went smoothly while we are gone. We come back, and the first day back when the owners come in to talk to us the energy is off. They were moody and short with us. Then the assistant manager who is a friend to us, comes to the back and says that she got upset with them while we were gone. Apparently they were talking poorly of us, and even though people were pointing out how hard of workers we are they seemed to have a chip on their shoulder about something. Not to mention they have demoted the other kitchen person from manager to idk what yet, except they haven't told him directly. They also hired a food and beverage director and shes seems to be the new person in charge. We have a meeting tomorrow. And then yesterday someone called out from their shift today. The other kitchen person and I both couldn't cover because we had plans. So I am hoping they aren't upset with me about that. It was literally the 2nd time in 3 years they asked me to cover someone's shift, and I couldn't. I pretty much always say yes. But I've seen how they are with past employees and they can be very spiteful. There's so much more stuff I could say, and examples I can give. At this point though, my anxiety is through the roof. I really liked this job, and working here but the owners have changed. I'm not really sure what to say to smooth things over at the meeting tomorrow? I'd at least like to be here another 6 months, or until I find something that can support me just as well. But I have cried and stressed so much about work the last few days."
48,3,"So I work in this restaurant, not going to say the name but there are other restaurants in the area and where I work we aren’t the best out of them all.  Anyways. This position I do makes me $10 an hour, I am a host.  Anyways. With the giving requirements I have I don’t think $10 cuts it.  They keep making up these new rules and it is a really strict position and I make $10 an hour. It could be busy and still.  I believe they take things I say and turn it around to something I never said.  The owner keeps raising prices on food but yet I make $10 an hour.  We also have this thing that is a little meeting with all staff before our shift.  All they do is put pressure on us right before our shift and make us feel bad like we all do everything wrong. What a joke, so should I quit?"
49,3,"LONG POST:I have been working at my current employer for over two years. It is a large organization but not really diverse. In my unit there are only a handful of BIPOC people and in my department there are two of us.

A few of my experiences include:

While working on one of my first assignments a colleague who was supposed to support me was hyper critical of my work and that affected me a great deal. I already felt like I didn't belong because of racial/ethnic differences but then I felt like my intelligence was always tested or disregarded. The director called me out at nearly every meeting to talk about the work I manage and even voluntold me to present on it before I had a chance to get a clear understanding of what it was I was even doing. Effectively making it clear that he did not think I was equipped for the job.

My team normally discounts the work of every Black person they work with. Either their work isn't up to par or they lack the ability to do their job. They tend to put Black people on the spot or throw them under the bus, but overlook any mistakes their non-Black counterparts make.

I've been volunteered to be a part of different programs. For example, two teammates asked me if I'd be okay with them writing a proposal to present at a conference. I had a lot on my plate but I agreed because I thought it would look bad otherwise. Once accepted into the conference, one teammate said he did not see a need for him to contribute to developing the presentation.

In general meetings, I have developed a habit of not speaking because 1) I anticipate that someone will find error in something I've said, 2) someone will pushback on what I've said, 3) the body language from the group suggest they don't want to hear what I have to say.

During the onboarding process, I was not given much guidance about anything. I had an email and was asked to work on a special project. No one talked to me about how things were done in the past. I was sent a handful of links and papers to review but that was it. I was not invited to planning meetings to observe -- or anything. I really had to figure things out on my own. (Which I am learning is quite different from how other people are onboarded).

In short, I wonder if I was a token hire and was only meant to represent diversity. I don't truly believe that my teammates think I can do my job -- even when I've proven that not to be true. The harder I work and better I get, the more I feel like I do not belong.

I have had some support from upper level management so it's not ALL bad all the time. Just when I have to interact with most of my peers.

Is it me or am I working in a toxic environment?

Also, promise it's my last thing.

If my teammates get promoted but we all do the same work, is that weird? (They have worked here longer so I would get it if that were the reasoning. But if I got the same new responsibilities and have to go through the same additional training that they are, shouldn't that lead to a promotion/title change for me too?)"
50,3,It has been a headache working with such toxic coworkers.  I took one day off and I came back the next day with a bunch of emails from bosses asking why my work is not in. There is a woman at work who told the whole team that I wasn't doing work last week and accused me of deleting MY OWN work this week. What should I do? I honestly think she just hates all women at work and gives favors to the men. I'm a new engineer and I'm still on the student loans.  I'm afraid to even work now because people at work are making me stressed. I'm not seeing my future at all because of this woman. I'm afraid going to a new team won't solve the problems. I don't know what to do seems like all women are jealous of me and I'm not even that good-looking.  Women hate me no matter where I go.

53,3,"Hi all, first post so please be kind.

I have been in working in my industry (finance) for the last 9 years and I am in the process of transitioning into a new career (2 years from now after part time schooling). I've decided that I need this change because I am unhappy in my job and I don't feel that I am the right fit for it. Frankly, I don't think I am competent in the role and impostered my way through somehow. 

I've tried moving to different companies but it's the same role with the same challenges. I've also looked into other related career paths but I am just ready to move on and do something different. 

Knowing that I am on my way out in 2 year's time, I should be more 'carefree' about the day to day challenges of my job but all I do is stress about all my responsibilities and have this constant fear of doing the wrong thing and getting fired. I do want to mentioned that this is a new company I have been working for and it's been half a year. My current role is more complex than the previous (requires a lot of analysis and making decisions) and there's pressure & set targets to sell the company's products and all of it is very overwhelming. I've had meltdown during work and I spent nights restless dealing with the anxiety. I feel trapped and I hate the feeling everyday. 

I wish I could quit and switch careers right now but it's not going to happen that way unfortunately. I know people deal with work stress differently and maybe the only thing I can do is tough it out but any tips on dealing with this? I tend to overthink and care too much so it doesn't help. 

Thanks for reading."

Director says we should be doing over time right now. I understand that people work differently but in order to clear the amount of work we have, each of us would need to be working an extra 20 hours at week. I can’t do it.

It's not like I'm ever going to hangout with my coworkers like we're friends outside of work. No. I have work to do at work. I don't want my time compromised by coffee pot conversation like he likes to call it in the video.

I honestly find this reason to go back to work useless. It doesn't do anything for productivity. It's meaningless conversations about pets, kids, life events etc. I don't want to sit there and listen to something I really have no interest in. I am there to do a job.

62,3,"30year old - been working since 21 in IT.

Moved 5-6 years to a small company. Besides the CEO, after some seniors left I am the next one in seniority. Picked up a few projects to lead as our team grew. Mostly because no one else was available.

I truly appreciate all the things the CEO is doing, I am getting preferential treatment (I can't drive and he often takes me home, I get bigger bonuses). I did not ask for any of them. They make me fell like I should work even more and try to do things even better.

I don't think I am fit to be a project lead because I am controlling and overbearing. Also I think because of the control issues, I end up always with half done things that need my input/dev and I am becoming a bottle neck. People are frustrated that I am always in calls or don't have time, the half done tasks are half forgotten when I manage to get back to them.

Few of the projects I am in are not going too well, provided they are more research based and complex and not completely up to me.

I work 8-12PM. Weekends go by without notice as I cannot get out of bed (I spend time thinking I am a piece of shit for not finishing my tasks).

Had a fight with the boss today, as I told him I cannot keep up and I am sick of having to follow up always on projects and don't get to do any dev anymore. He does a lot of interesting things and important projects and also works many hours, but he gets bored fast and does not follow up on tasks. When I follow up on tasks that were with him/under his management he gets upset. Understandable, but if I don't he says that no one reminded him and he can't do everything himself.

We have some tedious projects that are with me and need a lot of manual work. He thinks I should push back more to the clients as I am destroying the team with boring and annoying tasks.

Today I burst into tears and told him that I cannot follow up anymore on tasks, I am tired of having to pick up pieces and be support for all issues. All the tasks that come back to me keep pilling up and I feel I will never finish anything.

After getting home at 9PM and trying to catch up on my work. I get an email from him saying he decided to close the business. This is after the argument I started.

How can I apologize? Should I hand in my resignation and work a few month without pay to train some colleagues in my place. I think I am the root of all evil as I am stressful and overbearing. I am not sure who to change.

What can I do?"
63,3,"I have worked for more than decade from my previous job, and being sacked because of COVID last year.
Finally, I got a new job and my stress crashed my mind.
It seems that my previous job experience means nothing to the new job, and it makes believe that I am a idiot. It’s a totally different working atmosphere, everyone here is nice, and keep encouraging me I am a good at my expertise, but I am sure I know nothing about it and I believe those fresh graduated colleague even better than me. I can’t finish any report, I learn nothing from their previous work, and I can’t even write a complete article/email because I believe I cannot meet the standard. What can I do? I don’t want to quit, but I can’t breathe now."
64,3,"So there is a long weekend coming up and I figured I already work from home most days so I asked my boss the night before if it was fine to work from home the day before the long weekend. He replied to my email saying he doesn't have an issue but assuming I was partying or doing drugs and that's the reason why I wanted to work from home. (I don't party or drink) He didn't use those exact words but it was implied in the email. ""I don't like that you're telling me instead of asking... The fact that it's 11:30 at night makes me wonder the reason why"". Like I couldn't sleep last night because of anxiety and it's embarassing to talk about... I ended up deciding to go since he  seemed mad.

Also, I'm young I can get up early even if it's late. Plus we have a daily meeting every morning at 7:30am so there is no hiding. Not to mention Ontario is planing another lockdown because of COVID cases sky rocketing. I even said that I would give an update at the end of the day.

I feel so insulted by him and idk if it's because I'm a women that he assumes we should just all be agreeable all the time. I don't want him to walk all over me. My boyfriend never has an issue when he asks his boss to do certain things so I don't understand... My email wasn't even agressive it was in good spirits."

66,3,"I honestly do not know where else to go to vent and seek advice for the stress I have been having with my work. I am 27 years old and work for an auto insurance company and this year is my 5th year. I got a promotion last March and have been working auto theft claims for the past year. Obviously this happened during the covid lockdown so I’ve been stuck at home like most of us. I loved the job at first but as the days went on I just feel awful with depression and stress. My anxiety is so bad that I have been throwing up everyday before work and it has gotten to be such a frequent thing that I’m vomiting blood. I have went to my doctor and have tried about every antidepressant out there with no luck and just decided to quit them all together. My anxiety got so bad that he prescribed me Xanax but I feel like it just makes the anxiety worse after it wears off after a short time. I have tried working out, meditation, and praying throughout the day but I cannot find any peace. It has gotten so bad that I have been having suicidal thoughts which is very disturbing to me as I have a one year old and would never do that to him. My wife also works at the same company and we have been home together this whole year and she is stressed too but not nearly to the level I’m at and I feel my stress is making her unhappy and makes me feel guilty. The job is so nerve racking as 7/10 claims are fraud and the customer is the one who either burned their own vehicle or hid it. Sometimes the vehicle never even existed. The one I got earlier this week involved a man stealing his parents car and be shot up a house and hit a 2 year old boy in the head. When I read that claim I cried! I love my boss and the company but the job itself is so hard and people today are so impatient and think they are owed everything.I think covid has everyone on edge. I wish  I could just quit but I’m making around 70k with a kinesiology degree so that’s as good as it gets. I will never find a job that pays this well that is 9-5 and lets me work from home. We bought a new house last may and my son is in daycare and I need the salary I have now to live comfortably. It’s just gotten so bad that I feel guilty for feeling guilty and I know people would kill to have a job that pays like mine, a beautiful wife, and the best son in the world. I have all that but yet, I’m insane! I barley sleep and have gotten so fearful of people that each day my job feels impossible. Im so  far past my breaking point and just need help."
67,3,"I am a ui/ux designer working in an IT company for 2 years, last month I had sent in my resignation letter to my manager, because I feel like don't really like the job scope of my work, I been doing graphic design instead of ui design for most of the time, and my coworker treated me like shit. After sending in my resignation letter, my manager had a discussion with me, I didn't mention about what my coworker did, because I don't want to start a conflict, so I used other excuses for my resignation. But my dad ask me to keep on working due to unstable economy during the pandemic, so after talking to the management I get to keep my job.

But now I suddenly received a better offer from another company, and I wanted to quit my job again. What can I do to ensure that I don't pissed off my manager for resigning again?"
68,3,"Hello everyone, I am new here. So alow me to introduce myself. I just got a job and it's great. I am learning a lot and the people for the most part are great. 

However, my boss doesn't want me to work from home... It's giving me such anxiety and unecessary stress.

During the job interview, they specifically said that the hours are flexible and that some people are working from home. I specifically asked this question because I want to work from home for the most part. However, it seems like they want me to be in the office at all times dispite what happened in the interview. 

I am not sure what to do here. I tested the waters by working from home one week. No feedback. Until I emailed about creating a in-out office schedule that works with everyone. Then my manager said he didn't want to do this and literally said flat out they want me to be in the office at all times. Wtf?

What's is so wrong about me working from home? I'm just a drafter. And I have an hour long training session with someone from the office on Microsoft teams everyday. He works from home. I send all my stuff via email and ask for feedback often. I don't receive much feedback from my boss or project manager. 

I am just super frustrated because they said they were flexible. Lol not. It's bullshit honestly. I have a way better computer at home that has no issues. I have a way more comfortable chair to sit on that doesn't hurt my back. I have 3 huge monitors and one of them is 4k resolution. All I have at the office is a shitty chair 2 average monitors and just a laptop as a computer to use. I am not saying I am ungreatful but I am way better set up at home then at the office. Not to mention, it's quiet. I don't have to hear unecessary chatter when I'm trying to listen to my collegue online. 

It's literally a pandemic and they don't take it as seriously as I would have expected.

So upset right now..."
69,3,"An easy way to reduce work related stress that you can perform even while you're at work is deep breathing exercises.

There are many benefits to deep breathing and they include improved stress management, reduced anxiety and an increase in focus. It helps minimize the way your brain perceives stress. The result is a calmer and more focused state of mind. Taking time each day to practice deep breathing has greatly helped me manage my stress better and I wanted to share this with you all to try too! If you have some doubts about the science behind this, [here is an article](https://claritychi.com/the-science-of-deep-breathing-and-why-its-vital-to-health/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=the-science-of-deep-breathing-and-why-its-vital-to-health) that explains it. Let me know if this helps anyone!"

Thank you to those who have already participated. I'm looking for **employees from any occupation (part-time or full-time)** to take part in my online survey exploring **capability to manage work-related stress.** Here's the study link if you're interested: [https://chesterpsychology.fra1.qualtrics.com/.../SV...](https://chesterpsychology.fra1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6hY5RaSWI5cN19H?fbclid=IwAR2FAEH0kssVJBrOZ78qUVswtRUSoVoc3xeo68A-04jKRcOa4Bi8DfwNxyM)

Feel free to share with colleagues and friends :)"
72,3,"Hi everyone, my name is Will Kent. I’m a PhD student at the University of Chester in the UK. I’m looking for participants for my online study (see link below) which aims to develop a measure of self-efficacy for managing work-related stress. Psychologists suggest that if you believe you are capable of managing stress, you’re more likely to engage in stress-management behaviors in the future, so there’s a need to accurately measure this in studies. Eligible participants are over the age of 16, currently employed (part-time or full-time), and able to understand written English. The study should take around 15-20 minutes. Thanks in advance!
