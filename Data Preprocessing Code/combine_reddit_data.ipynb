However, there have been two instances now where the police have come to our house because she‚Äôs used the hotline and stopped responding. In both situations, she got in trouble and lost phone access or other privileges. After both situations, my mom has completely freaked out yet my sister doesn‚Äôt understand the severity it seems. \n",

      "This most recent time at inpatient was most severe. She was taken out of school staring February and has been doing online work. She is now in outpatient for about a month and will then continue to have therapy sessions for 4 hours for a month. She is in 8th grade, and I think she‚Äôs realizing how much she missed out on, leading to more depression. She ended up at inpatient this time after running into the street after therapy to try and get hit by a car. Her grades had been good (besides math), no friend drama, and she had started to learn guitar. \n",

Not to mention, my OCPD and avoidant personality. I also struggle with Anorexia that had ravaged my health, for 9 years, at points being forced onto a feeding tube.

Now, whenever I feel worthless, I just starve myself and feel kind of relieved that I feel hungry.\n",

It's bad enough that I don't sleep without my head covered, though my girlfriend has been helping me get over that(she doesn't know why I do it). I know that sounds batshit insane, which is why I've never told anyone, not even my therapist. I've never trusted anyone, the person I've been the most mask off with is my girlfriend, but I never pull it off completely, unless I'm \"dissociated\" around her. I also have these rare moments where I lose grip on reality. Like this one time I was washing the dishes, when the plate I was holding started breathing, it made me angry, and so I screamed at it to stop breathing, and almost broke it, but I caught myself last second. Luckily I was home alone, so no one heard. I don't have visual hallucinations often, and audio hallucinations are only a bit more common. Though, I feel thing all the time, if I sit for long enough, I start to feel things under my skin, and I can \"feel\" peoples some people's \"auras\", it feels like a light cold fluid that clings to your skin, and it's not air, or wind, that stuff is different. I also used to see a shadow person in my childhood house, who would walk the same path everyday, ending in my room. I know my great grandmother was schizophrenic, and I've been wondering If some of that passed down to me.

Growing up, we were both crazy, extroverted, opinionated, and had similar upbringings and families in general. She was always so confident and fun, and we did everything together, even sometimes with our respective families. We had other friends too, all of which I am still very close with, however, since college, she has struggled to keep in touch with most people.

While she is still very caring and genuinely enjoys hanging out and chatting, she has developed severe anxiety (which she admits and is getting treatment for, however, she is even anxious about the treatment) that honestly makes it a bit draining to hang out with her. I can see it keeping her from enjoying her every day life, and through our conversations, I finally realize just how bad it has gotten.  My fun-loving, care- free friend who doesn‚Äôt care what anyone thinks is gone, and as her only close friend, I want to help in any way I can. One thing to note, she does have a past experience with an eating disorder (anorexia), however, she does not look physically unhealthy like she used to whatsoever.

She has an extremely regimented life with work, gym, eating, and so on, but she has barely any social life and pushes people away. As her best friend, I saw through that and kept reaching out until she opened up to me, and she tells me how much she enjoys our time and values my friendship, but I am tired of watching her spiral every time we hang out with no ability to help or give advice. My best guess is there is a combination of anxiety, eating disorder (for additional reasons not listed), severe indecisiveness?? perfectionism, and maybe ADHD, but I  just want to hear from someone who might relate to her how I can help.

She has schizoaffective disorder and I have bpd. When we met I was going through a separation from my ex wife, it wasn‚Äôt very long but I immediately connected with this girl. We slept together 3 separate times it was amazing but I didn‚Äôt want to hurt her because of everything I was going through so I said we shouldn‚Äôt be anything and tried to dip, I ended up coming back but she wasn‚Äôt as nice so for a year she hardly texted back, she rejected me a lot and it was hard to get her attention. I was going through a lot while this was happening I ended up moving to Oregon back in with my parents to get my crap together. She ended up contacting me and asking to maybe be together in a year because she liked me and wanted to learn to trust me. For the last 4 months it was going well we really understood each other but fights would happen because we are both obviously traumatized from our past but recently they were going to therapy and dealing with recent trauma and they didn‚Äôt seem okay. I tried to be as supportive as possible but that trauma involved me and information I didn‚Äôt know they were doing in the last year my jealousy got the better of me, my communication got bad so they started fighting with me even when I wasn‚Äôt doing anything wrong. I tried to talk about it but they just wouldn‚Äôt talk about it or blamed me for my reactions. I got mad. They started distancing themselves a lot. Told me they stopped taking their meds. I thought since they told me stuff they did last year I‚Äôd tell them stuff too except my stuff involved my ex wife which they are sensitive about they blew up after that. We fought non stop after that. They made me feel crazy and I said I hated calling and a bunch of stuff I didn‚Äôt mean. They stopped talking completely and I tried to force them to talk because I got confused on what happened and they told me they were mad and how we weren‚Äôt anything anymore and that I had lost their trust and I had to start from the very beginning. I freaked out and said I didn‚Äôt want to pursue them they said ok and then I freaked out more begging them not to go. So now we are still talking but I am trying to recourt them like I did last year. I just don‚Äôt know if they are triggered or what or if I have a chance, like I know I messed up but it also just seems like they aren‚Äôt there. What do I do?\n"

Eventually our parents found out. He‚Äôs basically been in various levels of inpatient and residential treatment for the past 2 years, being kicked out of most programs due to multiple s*****e attempts, moved to higher levels of treatment, kicked out again, flown to a different state, new meds, ECT, same thing on repeat. He‚Äôs been far less communicative with me through all this and when he does talk to me, I kind of feel like I‚Äôm being used. I used to send him gifts and stuff, try to keep supporting him, but he would act like things were better to me and our parents literally hours before another attempt.\n",

My parents caught him, but didn‚Äôt call the police nor take him to the hospital because they said he didn‚Äôt want that. I‚Äôm not even sure what number this is, maybe 4 or 5 in the past year or two? These were all attempts in which he was actively caught in the act and saved.

My brother barely speaks to me and when he does I feel like it‚Äôs lies. He used to ask for money. I feel like I just don‚Äôt want to deal with any of it anymore. I feel like I can‚Äôt handle the roller coaster, the lack of support myself, the deception from my brother, and the fact that no one seems to be looking at this properly. He needs to be back in a hospital, not living as a permanent child. He used to be my best friend honestly. He never used to be like this. I mean, the ED was hidden I guess, but the rest of this? Like I‚Äôm per positive we‚Äôre going to lose him at some point and I‚Äôm going to have to deal with that, telling my kids that, dealing with my parents.

They don‚Äôt seem to be doing therapy themselves and they‚Äôre too private to tell their own siblings, so it‚Äôs all on me. Do I just cut them all off until I‚Äôm in a better place? I‚Äôve told them I‚Äôm struggling but it doesn‚Äôt seem to matter.

I‚Äôve consistently been in therapy since then, and those diagnoses have never been questioned. Shortly afterwards, I started seeing my psychiatrist. I can‚Äôt say I have ever felt super fond of her, but it never caused issues. The past few months, I‚Äôve started to question if I should keep seeing her though.\n",

I also started esketamine treatments and have been looking into group therapies of different modules. My new therapist suggested I apply for disability benefits, which I did. Sometime after I started that process, my psychiatrist asked if I really thought it was a good idea to do so, that I seemed to have been fine in the past when I‚Äôve worked, and that it might be more trouble than it‚Äôs worth. My OCD makes me question if I make up my symptoms and I already felt guilty applying, so her saying that sent me on a fairly intense OCD spiral that lasted for a couple of weeks. I brought it up to her next session, and she apologized and said she thinks I actually downplay my issues and wrote a letter to Social Security as testament to my struggles. She later told me that my mood seems to be fairly reactive, and then last session said she thinks I have BPD.\n",

My last therapist and my neuropsychologist screened me for it previously as well and said I didn‚Äôt have it. Along with that, even if I \\*did\\*, I don‚Äôt want that on my chart given the stigma I know it carries in the mental health field. After the session, I sent an email stating all that, and she said we‚Äôll discuss it at our next appointment. It really frustrated me, so I brought it up to my therapist and the NP who oversees my esketamine treatments. Both seemed extremely reluctant and wouldn‚Äôt give a straight answer on whether they agreed or not. My therapist said that if I had it, it was an atypical presentation, but that my psychiatrist has seen me for longer and she didn‚Äôt want to muddle the waters. While I understand that, I‚Äôm more inclined to trust their opinion over my psychiatrist, since though I‚Äôve been her client for years, she only sees me for a max of an hour total a month, where we mostly discuss medications. My other providers see me hourly every week, where I can go into depth about my issues and the reasoning behind them.\n",

It makes me feel less alone and gives me hope that I can get better one day.
